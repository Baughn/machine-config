    At home there was a game that all the parents played with their
    children. It was called, What Did You See? Mara was about Dann’s age
    when she was first called into her father’s room one evening, where he
    sat in his big carved and coloured chair. He said to her, ‘And now we
    are going to play a game. What was the thing you liked best today?’

    At first she chattered: ‘I played with my cousin . . . I was out with
    Shera in the garden . . . I made a stone house.’ And then he had said,
    ‘Tell me about the house.’ And she said, ‘I made a house of the stones
    that come from the river bed.’ And he said, ‘Now tell me about the
    stones.’ And she said, ‘They were mostly smooth stones, but some were
    sharp and had different shapes.’ ‘Tell me what the stones looked like,
    what colour they were, what did they feel like.’

    And by the time the game ended she knew why some stones were smooth
    and some sharp and why they were different colours, some cracked, some
    so small they were almost sand. She knew how rivers rolled stones
    along and how some of them came from far away. She knew that the river
    had once been twice as wide as it was now. There seemed no end to what
    she knew, and yet her father had not told her much, but kept asking
    questions so she found the answers in herself. Like, ‘Why do you think
    some stones are smooth and round and some still sharp?’ And she
    thought and replied, ‘Some have been in the water a long time, rubbing
    against other stones, and some have only just been broken off bigger
    stones.’ Every evening, either her father or her mother called her in
    for What Did You See? She loved it. During the day, playing outside or
    with her toys, alone or with other children, she found herself
    thinking, Now notice what you are doing, so you can tell them tonight
    what you saw.

    She had thought that the game did not change; but then one evening she
    was there when her little brother was first asked, What Did You See?
    and she knew just how much the game had changed for her. Because now
    it was not just What Did You See? but: What were you thinking? What
    made you think that? Are you sure that thought is true?

    When she became seven, not long ago, and it was time for school, she
    was in a room with about twenty children - all from her family or from
    the Big Family - and the teacher, her mother’s sister, said, ‘And now
    the game: What Did You See?’

    Most of the children had played the game since they were tiny; but
    some had not, and they were pitied by the ones that had, for they did
    not notice much and were often silent when the others said, ‘I saw . .
    .’, whatever it was. Mara was at first upset that this game played
    with so many at once was simpler, more babyish, than when she was with
    her parents. It was like going right back to the earliest stages of
    the game: ‘What did you see?’ ‘I saw a bird.’ ‘What kind of a bird?’
    ‘It was black and white and had a yellow beak.’ ‘What shape of beak?
    Why do you think the beak is shaped like that?’

    Then she saw what she was supposed to be understanding: Why did one
    child see this and the other that? Why did it sometimes need several
    children to see everything about a stone or a bird or a person?

    Tags like "stupid," "bad at __", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of
    saying "You're performing badly and I don't know why." Once you move
    it to "you're performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings,"
    or "you're performing badly because you don't understand what a limit

    When confronting something which may be either a windmill or an evil
    giant, what question should you be asking?

    There are some who ask, "If we do nothing, and that is an evil giant,
    can we afford to be wrong?" These people consider themselves to be
    brave and vigilant.

    Some ask "If we attack it wrongly, can we afford to pay to replace a
    windmill?" These people consider themselves cautious and pragmatic.

    Still others ask, "With the cost of being wrong so high in either
    case, shouldn't we always definitively answer the 'windmill vs. giant'
    question before we act?" And those people consider themselves
    objective and wise.

    But only a tiny few will ask, "Isn't the fact that we're giving equal
    consideration to the existence of evil giants and windmills a warning
    sign of insanity in ourselves?"

    It's hard to find out what these people consider themselves, because
    they never get invited to parties.

BBC: "Why ever would you have thought that?"

Don: "During my childhood, I read many of the Edgar Rice Burroughs
'Tarzan' stories, and in those books, whenever a lion wandered into a
clearing, the monkeys would leap into the trees and 'cast streams of
invective upon the lion's head.'"

BBC: long pause "But, surely sir, you now know the meaning of the word."

Don: "Yes, but I do wonder under what other misapprehensions I continue to

    And here, according to Trout, was the reason human beings could not
    reject ideas because they were bad: Ideas on Earth were badges of
    friendship or enmity. Their content did not matter. Friends agreed
    with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with
    enemies, in order to express enmity. The ideas Earthlings held didn’t
    matter for hundreds of thousands of years, since they couldn’t do much
    about them anyway. Ideas might as well be badges as anything.

On the error of failing to appreciate your opponents three-dimensionality:

    They had cliche answers but only to their self-created straw-men. To
    exaggerate only slightly, they had never talked to anyone who really
    believed, and had thought deeply about, views drastically different
    from their own. As a result, when they heard real arguments instead of
    caricatures, they had no answers, only amazement that such views could
    be expressed by someone who had the external characteristics of being
    a member of the intellectual community, and that such views could be
    defended with apparent cogency. Never have I been more impressed with
    the advice I once received: "You cannot be sure that you are right
    unless you understand the arguments against your views better than
    your opponents do."

    Once upon a time, there was a man who was riding in a horse drawn
    carriage and traveling to go take care of some affairs; and in the
    carriage there was also a very big suitcase. He told the driver to of
    the carriage to drive non-stop and the horse ran extremely fast.

    Along the road, there was an old man who saw them and asked, "Sir, you
    seem anxious, where do you need to go?"

    The man in the carriage then replied in a loud voice, "I need to go to
    the state of Chu." The old man heard and laughing he smiled and said,
    "You are going the wrong way. The state of Chu is in the south, how
    come you are going to to the north?"

    "That’s alright," The man in the carriage then said, "Can you not see?
    My horse runs very fast."

    "Your horse is great, but your path is incorrect."

    "It’s no problem, my carriage is new, it was made just last month."

    "Your carriage is brand new, but this is not the road one takes to get
    to Chu."

    "Old Uncle, you don’t know," and the man in the carriage pointed to
    the suitcase in the back and said, "In that suitcase there’s alot of
    money. No matter how long the road is, I am not afraid."

    "You have lots of money, but do not forget, The direction which you
    are going is wrong. I can see, you should go back the direction which
    you came from."

    The man in the carriage heard this and irritated said, "I have already
    been traveling for ten days, how can you tell me to go back from where
    I came?" He then pointed at the carriage driver and said, "Take a
    look, he is very young, and he drives very well, you needn’t worry.

    The person who says, as almost everyone does say, that human life is
    of infinite value, not to be measured in mere material terms, is
    talking palpable, if popular, nonsense. If he believed that of his own
    life, he would never cross the street, save to visit his doctor or to
    earn money for things necessary to physical survival. He would eat the
    cheapest, most nutritious food he could find and live in one small
    room, saving his income for frequent visits to the best possible
    doctors. He would take no risks, consume no luxuries, and live a long
    life. If you call it living. If a man really believed that other
    people's lives were infinitely valuable, he would live like an
    ascetic, earn as much money as possible, and spend everything not
    absolutely necessary for survival on CARE packets, research into
    presently incurable diseases, and similar charities.

    In fact, people who talk about the infinite value of human life do not
    live in either of these ways. They consume far more than they need to
    support life. They may well have cigarettes in their drawer and a
    sports car in the garage. They recognize in their actions, if not in
    their words, that physical survival is only one value, albeit a very
    important one, among many.

    "Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the
    best? I will tell you now." He touched the tip of his little finger
    lightly to his eyelid. "The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart
    of it.

    "Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands
    strange and wonderful, and when they return their captains fetch queer
    animals to the Sealord’s menagerie. Such animals as you have never
    seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as
    stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers
    that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with
    scythes for claws. Syrio Forel has seen these things.

    "On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the
    Sealord sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been
    sent away, none could say why. When I came into his presence, he was
    seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of
    his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the
    sunrise. ‘Have you ever seen her like?’ he asked of me.

    "And to him I said, ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a
    thousand like him,’ and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named
    the first sword."

    Arya screwed up her face. "I don’t understand."

    Syrio clicked his teeth together. "The cat was an ordinary cat, no
    more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw.
    How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only
    fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What
    curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten
    fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and
    that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?"

    Arya thought about it. "You saw what was there."

    "Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and
    the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your
    eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your
    nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in

    . . . once upon a time men lived among the giants, who were like
    themselves but far more powerful, and these giants always had a supply
    of bread, fruit, milk, and all that was necessary to sustain life,
    which they must have acquired in ways that cost them little, for they
    would always give away their goods to whoever knew how to please them.
    And the giants would also carry them wherever they wanted to go,
    provided they asked in the proper way. So it came about that men never
    thought of working, nor of walking, nor of building wagons or ships;
    instead they became natural orators, and spent all of their time
    watching the giants, figuring out what would please or displease them,
    smiling at them or imploring them with tears in their eyes; or else
    simply pronouncing the necessary words, which had to be memorized
    exactly, though they had no understanding of the changes of humor that
    would come over the giants, their brusque refusals, or their sudden
    willingness. Now, if some man, in those days, had tried to get
    something for himself by his own industry, they would have laughed him
    to scorn; for the results of his labor would have been puny beside the
    immense provisions the giants had amassed; and besides with one false
    step the giants could easily have crushed those little beginnings of
    labor out of existence. That is why all human wisdom came down to
    knowing how to speak and how to persuade; and, rather than move things
    about with great effort, men chose to learn what words it would take
    to get one of the giants to do their moving. In short, their main
    business, or rather their only business, was to please, and above all
    not to displease, their incomprehensible masters, who seemed
    nevertheless to be charged with nourishing them and housing them and
    transporting them, and who eventually carried out their duties,
    provided they were prayed to. This kind of existence, in which men
    never knew whether they were the masters or the slaves, lasted for a
    long time, so that the habit of asking, of hoping, of counting on
    those stronger than themselves left indelible traces in human nature.
    . . . That is why, as if they were still waiting for the return of the
    giants, men do not forget to pray and make offerings, though no giant
    has ever shown himself . . .

    The tautological emptiness of a Master's Wisdom is exemplified in the
    inherent stupidity of proverbs. Let us engage in a mental experiment
    by way of trying to construct proverbial wisdom out of the
    relationship between terrestrial life, its pleasures, and its Beyond.
    If ones says, "Forget about the afterlife, about the Elsewhere, seize
    the day, enjoy life fully here and now, it's the only life you've
    got!" it sounds deep. If one says exactly the opposite ("Do not get
    trapped in the illusory and vain pleasures of earthly life; money,
    power, and passions are all destined to vanish into thin air - think
    about eternity!"), it also sounds deep. If one combines the two sides
    ("Bring Eternity into your everyday life, live your life on this earth
    as if it is already permeated by Eternity!"), we get another profound
    thought. Needless to add, the same goes for it's inversion: "Do not
    try in vain to bring together Eternity and your terrestrial life,
    accept humbly that you are forever split between Heaven and Earth!"
    If, finally, one simply gets perplexed by all these reversals and
    claims: "Life is an enigma, do not try to penetrate its secrets,
    accept the beauty of its unfathomable mystery!" the result is, again,
    no less profound than its reversal: "Do not allow yourself to be
    distracted by false mysteries that just dissimulate the fact that,
    ultimately, life is very simple - it is what it is, it is simply here
    without reason and rhyme!" Needless to add that, by uniting mystery
    and simplicity, one again obtains a wisdom: "The ultimate,
    unfathomable mystery of life resides in its very simplicity, in the
    simple fact that there is life."

    The Patrician took a sip of his beer. "I have told this to few people,

    young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a
    stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing
    sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother
    otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she
    subdued and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of
    course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to its day
    the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the
    delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on
    the delicacy. One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children
    dining upon mother and children. And that's when I first learned about

On the difficulties of correctly fine-tuning your signaling:

    I once expressed mild surprise at the presence of a garden gnome in an
    upper-middle-class garden …. The owner of the garden explained that
    the gnome was "ironic". I asked him, with apologies for my ignorance,
    how one could tell that his garden gnome was supposed to be an ironic
    statement, as opposed to, you know, just a gnome. He rather sniffily
    replied that I only had to look at the rest of the garden for it to be
    obvious that the gnome was a tounge-in-cheek joke.

    But surely, I persisted, garden gnomes are always something of a joke,
    in any garden—I mean, no-one actually takes them seriously or regards
    them as works of art. His response was rather rambling and confused
    (not to mention somewhat huffy), but the gist seemed to be that while
    the lower classes saw gnomes as intrinsically amusing, his gnome was
    amusing only because of its incongruous appearance in a "smart"
    garden. In other words, council-house gnomes were a joke, but his
    gnome was a joke about council-house tastes, effectively a joke about
    class….

    The man’s reaction to my questions clearly defined him as
    upper-middle, rather than upper class. In fact, his pointing out that
    the gnome I had noticed was "ironic" had already demoted him by half a
    class from my original assessment. A genuine member of the upper
    classes would either have admitted to a passion for garden gnomes … or
    said something like "Ah yes, my gnome. I’m very fond of my gnome." and
    left me to draw my own conclusions.

    Most people don't know the basic scientific facts about
    happiness—about what brings it and what sustains it—and so they don't
    know how to use their money to acquire it. It is not surprising when
    wealthy people who know nothing about wine end up with cellars that
    aren't that much better stocked than their neighbors', and it should
    not be surprising when wealthy people who know nothing about happiness
    end up with lives that aren't that much happier than anyone else's.
    Money is an opportunity for happiness, but it is an opportunity that
    people routinely squander because the things they think will make them
    happy often don't.

it right" by Elizabeth W. Dunn, Daniel T. Gilbert, Timothy D. Wilson in

    There is something about practical things that knocks us off our
    philosophical high horses. Perhaps Heraclitus really thought he
    couldn't step in the same river twice. Perhaps he even received tenure
    for that contribution to philosophy. But suppose some other ancient
    had claimed to have as much right as Heraclitus did to an ox
    Heraclitus had bought, on the grounds that since the animal had
    changed, it wasn't the same one he had bought and so was up for grabs.
    Heraclitus would have quickly come up with some ersatz, watered-down
    version of identity of practical value for dealing with property
    rights, oxen, lyres, vineyards, and the like. And then he might have
    wondered if that watered-down vulgar sense of identity might be a
    considerably more valuable concept than a pure and philosophical sort
    of identity that nothing has.

    A lot of outcomes about which we care deeply are not very predictable.
    For example, it is not comforting to members of a graduate school
    admissions committee to know that only 23% of the variance in later
    faculty ratings of a student can be predicted by a unit weighting of
    the student's undergraduate GPA, his or her GRE score, and a measure
    of the student's undergraduate institution selectivity -- but that is
    opposed to 4% based on those committee members' global ratings of the
    applicant. We want to predict outcomes important to us. It is only
    rational to conclude that if one method (a linear model) does not
    predict well, something else may do better. What is not rational -- in
    fact, it's irrational -- is to conclude that this something else
    necessarily exists and, in the absence of any positive supporting
    evidence, is intuitive global judgment.

From Thomas Macaulay's 1848 History of England.

    [W]e are under a deception similar to that which misleads the traveler
    in the Arabian desert. Beneath the caravan all is dry and bare; but
    far in advance, and far in the rear, is the semblance of refreshing
    waters... A similar illusion seems to haunt nations through every
    stage of the long progress from poverty and barbarism to the highest
    degrees of opulence and civilization. But if we resolutely chase the
    mirage backward, we shall find it recede before us into the regions of
    fabulous antiquity. It is now the fashion to place the golden age of
    England in times when noblemen were destitute of comforts the want of
    which would be intolerable to a modern footman, when farmers and
    shopkeepers breakfasted on loaves the very sight of which would raise
    a riot in a modern workhouse, when to have a clean shirt once a week
    was a privilege reserved for the higher class of gentry, when men died
    faster in the purest country air than they now die in the most
    pestilential lanes of our towns, and when men died faster in the lanes
    of our towns than they now die on the coast of Guiana.

.................................

    We too shall in our turn be outstripped, and in our turn be envied. It
    may well be, in the twentieth century, that the peasant of Dorsetshire
    may think himself miserably paid with twenty shillings a week; that
    the carpenter at Greenwich may receive ten shillings a day; that
    laboring men may be as little used to dine without meat as they are
    now to eat rye bread; that sanitary police and medical discoveries may
    have added several more years to the average length of human life;
    that numerous comforts and luxuries which are now unknown, or confined
    to a few, may be within the reach of every diligent and thrifty
    workingman. And yet it may then be the mode to assert that the
    increase of wealth and the progress of science have benefited the few
    at the expense of the many, and to talk of the reign of Queen Victoria
    as the time when England was truly merry England, when all classes
    were bound together by brotherly sympathy, when the rich did not grind

    Sometimes you hear philosophers bemoaning the fact that philosophers
    tend not to form consensuses like certain other disciplines do
    (sciences in particular). But there is no great mystery to this. The
    sciences reward consensus-forming as long as certain procedures are
    followed: agreements through experimental verification, processes of
    peer review, etc. Philosophy has nothing like this. Philosophers are
    rewarded for coming up with creative reasons not to agree with other
    people. The whole thrust of professional philosophy is toward
    inventing ways to regard opposing arguments as failure, as long as
    those ways don't exhibit any obvious flaws. However much philosophers
    are interested in the truth, philosophy as a profession is not
    structured so as to converge on it; it is structured so as to have the
    maximal possible divergence that can be sustained given common
    conventions. We are not trained to find ways to come to agree with
    each other; we are trained to find ways to disagree with each other.

    A few years into this book, I was diagnosed as diabetic and received a
    questionnaire in the mail. The insurance carrier stated that diabetics
    often suffer from depression and it was worried about me. One of the
    questions was "Do you think about death?" Yes, I do. "How often?" the
    company wanted to know. "Yearly? Monthly? Weekly? Daily?" And if
    daily, how many times per day? I dutifully wrote in, "About 70 times
    per day." The next time I saw my internist, she told me the insurer
    had recommended psychotherapy for my severe depression. I explained to
    her why I thought about death all day—merely an occupational
    hazard—and she suggested getting therapy nonetheless. I thought, fine,
    it might help with the research.

    The therapist found me tragically undepressed, and I asked her if she
    could help me design a new life that would maximize the few years that
    I had left. After all, one should have a different life strategy at
    sixty than at twenty. She asked why I thought I was going to die and
    why I had such a great fear of death. I said, I am going to die. It’s
    not a fear; it’s a reality. There must be some behavior that could be
    contraindicated for a man my age but other normally dangerous behavior
    that takes advantage of the fact that I am risking fewer years at
    sixty or sixty-five years of age than I was at twenty or twenty-five
    (such as crimes that carry a life sentence, crushing at age twenty but
    less so at age sixty-five). Surely psychology must have something to
    say on the topic. Turns out, according to my therapist, it does not.
    There was therapy for those with terminal illness, for the bereaved,
    for the about-to-be-bereaved, for professionals who dealt with
    terminal patients, and so on, but there was nothing for people who
    were simply aware that their life would come to a natural end. It
    would seem to me that this is a large, untapped market. The therapist
    advised me not to think about death.

    Two very different attitudes toward the technical workings of
    mathematics are found in the literature. Already in 1761, Leonhard
    Euler complained about isolated results which "are not based on a
    systematic method" and therefore whose "inner grounds seem to be
    hidden." Yet in the 20'th Century, writers as diverse in viewpoint as
    Feller and de Finetti are agreed in considering computation of a
    result by direct application of the systematic rules of probability
    theory as dull and unimaginative, and revel in the finding of some
    isolated clever trick by which one can see the answer to a problem
    without any calculation.

    [...]

    Feller's perception was so keen that in virtually every problem he was
    able to see a clever trick; and then gave only the clever trick. So
    his readers get the impression that:

        Probability theory has no systematic methods; it is a collection
        of isolated, unrelated clever tricks, each of which works on one
        problem but not on the next one.  Feller was possessed of
        superhuman cleverness.  Only a person with such cleverness can
        hope to find new useful results in probability theory.

    Indeed, clever tricks do have an aesthetic quality that we all
    appreciate at once. But we doubt whether Feller, or anyone else, was
    able to see those tricks on first looking at the problem. We solve a
    problem for the first time by that (perhaps dull to some) direct
    calculation applying our systematic rules. After seeing the solution,
    we may contemplate it and see a clever trick that would have led us to
    the answer much more quickly. Then, of course, we have the opportunity
    for gamesmanship by showing others only the clever trick, scorning to
    mention the base means by which we first found.

    British philosophy is more detailed and piecemeal than that of the
    Continent; when it allows itself some general principle, it sets to
    work to prove it inductively by examining its various applications.
    Thus Hume, after announcing that there is no idea without an
    antecedent impression, immediately proceeds to consider the following
    objection: suppose you are seeing two shades of colour which are
    similar but not identical, and suppose you have never seen a shade of
    colour intermediate between the two, can you nevertheless imagine such
    a shade? He does not decide the question, and considers that a
    decision adverse to his general principle would not be fatal to him,
    because his principle is not logical but empirical. When--to take a
    contrast--Leibniz wants to establish his monadology, he argues,
    roughly, as follows: Whatever is complex must be composed of simple
    parts; what is simple cannot be extended; therefore everything is
    composed of parts having no extension. But what is not extended is not
    matter. Therefore the ultimate constituents of things are not
    material, and, if not material, then mental. Consequently a table is
    really a colony of souls.

    The difference of method, here, may be characterized as follows: In
    Locke or Hume, a comparatively modest conclusion is drawn from a broad
    survey of many facts, whereas in Leibniz a vast edifice of deduction
    is pyramided upon a pin-point of logical principle. In Leibniz, if the
    principle is completely true and the deductions are entirely valid,
    all is well; but the structure is unstable, and the slightest flaw
    anywhere brings it down in ruins. In Locke or Hume, on the contrary,
    the base of the pyramid is on the solid ground of observed fact, and
    the pyramid tapers upward, not downward; consequently the equilibrium
    is stable, and a flaw here or there can be rectified without total
    disaster.

    One thing I have advocated, without much success, is that children be
    taught social rules (when they are ready) in exactly the same way they
    are taught and teach each other games. The point is not whether the
    rules are right or wrong. Are the rules of 5-card stud poker or
    hopscotch right or wrong? It's that we're playing a certain game here,
    and there are rules to this game just as in any other game. If you
    want to be in the game, then you have to learn how to play it.
    Different groups of people play different games (different rules =
    different game), so if you want to play in different groups, you have
    to learn the games they play. When you develop the levels of
    understanding above the rule level, you'll be able to understand all
    games, and be able to join in anywhere. You won't be stuck knowing how
    to play only one game.

    My problem with selling this idea is that people tend to think that
    their game is the only right one. In fact, being told that they are
    playing a game with arbitrary rules is insulting or frightening. They
    want to believe that the rules they know are the ones that everyone
    ought to play by; they even set up systems of punishment and reward to
    make sure that nobody tries to play a different game. They turn the
    game into something that is deadly serious, and so my idea simply
    seems frivolous instead of liberating.

    What is more important in determining an (individual) organism's
    phenotype, its genes or its environment? Any developmental biologist
    knows that this is a meaningless question. Every aspect of an
    organism's phenotype is the joint product of its genes and its
    environment. To ask which is more important is like asking, Which is
    more important in determining the area of a rectangle, the length or
    the width? Which is more important in causing a car to run, the engine
    or the gasoline? Genes allow the environment to influence the
    development of phenotypes.

    Another learning which cost me much to recognize, can be stated in
    four words. The facts are friendly.

    It has interested me a great deal that most psychotherapists,
    especially the psychoanalysts, have steadily refused to make any
    scientific investigation of their therapy, or to permit others to do
    this. I can understand this reaction because I have felt it.
    Especially in our early investigations I can well remember the anxiety
    of waiting to see how the findings came out. Suppose our hypotheses
    were disproved! Suppose we were mistaken in our views! Suppose our
    opinions were not justified! At such times, as I look back, it seems
    to me that I regarded the facts as potential enemies, as possible
    bearers of disaster. I have perhaps been slow in coming to realize
    that the facts are always friendly. Every bit of evidence one can
    acquire, in any area, leads one that much closer to what is true. And
    being closer to the truth can never be a harmful or dangerous or
    unsatisfying thing. So while I still hate to readjust my thinking,
    still hate to give up old ways of perceiving and conceptualizing, yet
    at some deeper level I have, to a considerable degree, come to realize
    that these painful reorganizations are what is known as learning, and
    that though painful they always lead to a more satisfying because
    somewhat more accurate way of seeing life. Thus at the present time
    one of the most enticing areas for thought and speculation is an area
    where several of my pet ideas have not been upheld by the evidence, I
    feel if I can only puzzle my way through this problem that I will find
    a much more satisfying approximation to the truth. I feel sure the
    facts will be my friends.

    'One day when I was a junior medical student, a very important Boston

    At the end of the lecture, a young student at the back of the room
    timidly asked, "Do you have any controls?" Well, the great surgeon
    drew himself up to his full height, hit the desk, and said, "Do you
    mean did I not operate on half the patients?" The hall grew very quiet
    then. The voice at the back of the room very hesitantly replied, "Yes,
    that’s what I had in mind." Then the visitor’s fist really came down

    Should we then call the original replicator molecules 'living'? Who
    cares? I might say to you 'Darwin was the greatest man who has ever
    lived', and you might say 'No, Newton was', but I hope we would not
    prolong the argument. The point is that no conclusion of substance
    would be affected whichever way our argument was resolved. The facts
    of the lives and achievements of Newton and Darwin remain totally
    unchanged whether we label them 'great' or not. Similarly, the story
    of the replicator molecules probably happened something like the way I
    am telling it, regardless of whether we choose to call them 'living'.
    Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp
    that words are only tools for our use, and that the mere presence in
    the dictionary of a word like 'living' does not mean it necessarily
    has to refer to something definite in the real world. Whether we call
    the early replicators living or not, they were the ancestors of life;
    they were our founding fathers.

    But, there's another problem, and that is the fact that statistical
    and probabilistic thinking is a real damper on "intellectual"
    conversation. By this, I mean that there are many individuals who wish
    to make inferences about the world based on data which they observe,
    or offer up general typologies to frame a subsequent analysis. These
    individuals tend to be intelligent and have college degrees. Their
    discussion ranges over topics such as politics, culture and
    philosophy. But, introduction of questions about the moments about the
    distribution, or skepticism as to the representativeness of their
    sample, and so on, tends to have a chilling affect on the regular flow
    of discussion. While the average human being engages mostly in gossip
    and interpersonal conversation of some sort, the self-consciously
    intellectual interject a bit of data and abstraction (usually in the
    form of jargon or pithy quotations) into the mix. But the raison
    d'etre of the intellectual discussion is basically signaling and
    cuing; in other words, social display. No one really cares about the
    details and attempting to generate a rigorous model is really beside
    the point. Trying to push the N much beyond 2 or 3 (what you would see

    Therefore, the first and most important duty of philosophy is to test
    impressions, choosing between them and only deploying those that have
    passed the test. You know how, with money--an area where we believe
    our interest to be at stake--we have developed the art of assaying,
    and considerable ingenuity has gone into developing a way to test if
    coins are counterfeit, involving our senses of sight, smell, hearing,
    and touch. The assayer will let the denarius drop and listen intently
    to its ring; and he is not satisfied to listen just once: after
    repeated listenings he practically acquires a musician's subtle ear.
    It is a measure of the effort we are prepared to expend to guard
    against deception when accuracy is at a premium.

    When it comes to our poor mind, however, we can't be bothered; we are
    satisfied accepting any and all impressions, because here the loss we
    suffer is not obvious. If you want to know just how little concerned
    you are about things good and bad, and how serious about things
    indifferent, compare your attitude to going blind with your attitude
    about being mentally in the dark. You will realize, I think, how
    inappropriate your values really are.

How a game theorist buys a car:

    "Hello, my name is Bruce Bueno de Mesquita. I plan to buy the
    following car [list the exact model and features] today at five P.M. I
    am calling all of the dealerships within a fifty-mile radius of my
    home and I am telling each of them what I am telling you. I will come
    in and buy the car today at five P.M. from the dealer who gives me the
    lowest price. I need to have the all-in price, including taxes, dealer
    prep [I ask them not to prep the car and not charge me for it, since
    dealer prep is little more than giving you a washed car with plastic
    covers and paper floormats removed, usually for hundreds of dollars],
    everything, because I will make out the check to your dealership
    before I come and will not have another check with me."

Other car-buying tips from Bueno de Mesquita, in case you're about to buy
a car:

    * Figure out exactly what car you want to buy by searching online
    * before making any contact with dealerships.

    * Don't be afraid to purchase a car from a distant dealership--the
    * manufacturer provides the warranty, not the dealer.

    * Be sure to tell each dealer you will be sharing the price they quote
    * you with subsequent dealers.

    * Don't take shit from dealers who tell you "you can't buy a car over
    * the phone" or do anything other than give you their number. If a
    * dealer is stonewalling, make it quite clear that you're willing to
    * get what you want elsewhere.

    * Arrive at the lowest-price dealer just before 5:00 PM to close the
    * deal.  In the unlikely event that the dealer changes their terms, go
    * for the next best price.

    Among a great many other things that chess teaches you is to control
    the initial excitement you feel when you see something that looks
    good. It trains you to think before grabbing, and to think just as
    objectively when you're in trouble. When you're making a film you have
    to make most of your decisions on the run, and there is a tendency to
    always shoot from the hip. It takes more discipline than you might
    imagine, to think, even for thirty seconds, in the noisy, confusing,
    high-pressure atmosphere of a film set. But a few seconds' thought can
    often prevent a serious mistake being made about something that looks
    good at first glance. With respect to films, chess is more useful in
    preventing you from making mistakes than giving you ideas. Ideas come
    spontaneously and the discipline required to evaluate and put them to
    use tends to be the real work.

During the discussion of Pranknet on Slashdot about a month ago, I saw
this comment. It reminded me of our discussions about Newcomb's problem
and superrationality.

        I also disagree that our society is based on mutual trust. Volumes
        and volumes of laws backed up by lawyers, police, and jails show
        otherwise.

    That's called selection/observation bias. You're looking at only one
    side of the coin.

    I've lived in countries where there's a lot less trust than here. The
    notion of returning an opened product to a store and getting a full
    refund is based on trust (yes, there's a profit incentive, and some
    people do screw the retailers [and the retailers their customers --
    SB], but the system works overall). In some countries I've been to,
    this would be unfeasible: Almost everyone will try to exploit such a
    retailer.

    When a storm knocks out the electricity and the traffic lights stop
    working, I've always seen everyone obeying the rules. I doubt it's
    because they're worried about cops. It's about trust that the other
    drivers will do likewise. Simply unworkable in other places I've lived

Idle Rich Class") says:

    Yes, because to be treated as a boy was to be taken on the old
    footing. I had become a new person ; and those who knew the old person
    laughed at me. The only man who behaved sensibly was my tailor : he

-- John McCarthy, on mainstream environmentalism.

As someone who regularly gets into arguments about this, I can say that
he's definitely right; you wouldn't believe the amount of nonsense that
can be disposed of simply by looking up the relevant numbers and doing a
minute's worth of easy arithmetic.

For example, I've heard some people recently claiming that a combination
of solar photovoltaics, electrolysis to produce hydrogen, and these new
Bloom box fuel cells are cheaper than nuclear fission. Look up the costs
of solar farms; about $3 per peak watt. Their average power output is
less; we can very optimistically assume that they run at 20% of capacity
on average. Efficiency losses from electrolysis and fuel cells are about
50%. Putting it all together, this would cost about $30 per watt of
average power delivered. Not including the cost of the fuel cells.

A little googling will show that the total cost of building two new AP1000
reactors in Georgia is about $14 billion, and they average at least 93% of
their peak power, and transmission line losses bring their average power
delivered to about 1000 MW each. So their cost is about $7 per watt of
average power delivered, or about 23% the cost of solar.

There's a lot of extremely harmful bullshit out there, and defeating most
of it doesn't take any advanced techniques; it just takes a willingness to
look up some relevant numbers and do a bit of arithmetic.

    Sometimes, apparently rational self-interested strategies turn out (as
    in the prisoners' dilemma) to be self-defeating. This may look like a
    defeat for rationality, but it is not. Rationality is saved by its own
    open-endedness. If a strategy of following accepted rules of
    rationality is sometimes self-defeating, this is not the end. We
    revise the rules to take account of this, so producing a higher-order
    rationality strategy. This in turn may fail, but again we go up a
    level. At whatever level we fail, there is always the process of
    standing back and going up a further level.

    A Thinking Machine! Yes, we can now have our thinking done for us by
    machinery! The Editor of the Common School Advocate says—" On our way
    to Cincinnati, a few days since, we stopped over night where a
    gentleman from the city was introducing a machine which he said was
    designed to supercede the necessity and labor of thinking. It was
    highly and respectably recommended, by men too in high places, and is
    designed for a calculator, to save the trouble of all mathematical
    labor. By turning the machinery it produces correct results in
    addition, substraction, multiplication, and division, and the operator
    assured us that it was equally useful in fractions and the higher
    mathematics." The Editor thinks that such machines, by which the
    scholar may, by turning a crank, grind out the solution of a problem
    without the fatigue of mental application, would by its introduction
    into schools, do incalculable injury, But who knows that such machines
    when brought to greater perfection, may not think of a plan to remedy
    all their own defects and then grind out ideas beyond the ken of
    mortal mind!"

    One day, I was playing with an "express wagon," a little wagon with a

    went to my father and said, "Say, Pop, I noticed something. When I
    pull the wagon, the ball rolls to the back of the wagon. And when I'm
    pulling it along and I suddenly stop, the ball rolls to the front of
    the wagon. Why is that?"

    "That, nobody knows," he said. "The general principle is that things
    which are moving tend to keep on moving, and things which are standing
    still tend to stand still, unless you push them hard. This tendency is
    called 'inertia,' but nobody knows why it's true." Now, that's a deep

    The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you
    look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies

    they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own

    So, let's say some bros of mine and I have some hand-signals for, you
    know, bro stuff. And one of the signals means, "Oh, shit. Here comes
    that girl! You know. That girl. She's coming." That signal has a
    particular context. Eventually, one of my bros gets tired of sloppy
    use of the signal, and sets about laying out specifically what
    situations make a girl that girl. If I used the signal in a
    close-but-not-quite context, he'd handle it and then pull me aside and
    say, "I know she and I had that thing that one time, but we never...
    well, it wasn't quite THAT. You know? So that signal, it freaked me
    out, because I thought it had to be someone else. Make sure you're
    using it properly, okay?" And I'd be like, "Bro. Got it."

    Another friend of mine, he recognizes the sorts of situations we use
    the signal in have a common thread, so he begins using the hand signal
    for other situations, any situation that has the potential for both
    danger and excitement. So if someone invites us to this real sketchy
    bar, he'll give me the signal - "This could be bad. But what if it's
    not?" And I'd respond, "I see what you did there."

    Maybe you see where this is going. We're hanging out one day, and some
    guy suggests we crash some party. Bro #2 signals, and bro #1 freaks
    out, looking around. And then he's like, "OH FUCK I HAVE TO CALL HER."
    And #2 says, "No, dude, there's no one coming. I just meant, this is
    like one of those situations, you know?" And they're pissed at each
    other because they're using the same signal to mean different things.
    I'm not mad, because I generally know what they each mean, but I have
    more context than they do.

    The same thing probably happens with analytics and Continentals.

    Economists essentially have a sophisticated lack of understanding of
    economics, especially macroeconomics. I know it sounds ridiculous. But
    the reason why I tell people they should study economics is not so
    they’ll know something at the end—because I don’t think we know
    much—but because we’re good at thinking. Economics teaches you to
    think things through. What you see a lot of times in economics is
    disdain for other's lack of thinking. You have to think about the
    ramifications of policies in the short run, the medium run, and the
    long run. Economists think they’re good at doing that, but they’re
    good at doing that in the sense that they can write down a model that
    will help them think about it—not in terms of empirically knowing what
    the answers are. And we have gotten so enamored of thinking things
    through that the fact that we don’t know anything needs to bother us
    more. So, yes, it’s true that the average guy on the street doesn’t
    understand economics, and it’s also true that we don’t understand
    economics. We just have a more sophisticated lack of understanding
    than the guy on the street.

    In the wake of such suffering, there is no way to adequately explain

    made them even harder for the survivors to understand.

    "In a situation like this, it's only natural to want to assign blame,"
    said Dr. Frederick MacDougal of the National Center for Infectious

    factor is at fault. People are dying for such a wide range of
    reasons--gunshot wounds, black-lung disease, falls down elevator
    shafts--that we have been unable to isolate any single element as the
    cause."

    "No one simple explanation can encompass the enormous scope of this
    problem," MacDougal added. "And that's very difficult for most people
    to process psychologically."

    News flash, dearies: there’s lots of areas of life that aren’t

    all agree here is a hand, then we can go about discussing our world in
    meaningful ways. Skepticism just undermines a foundation and replaces
    it with nothing; it[']s paralyzing. The grounds for such radical
    skepticism don't exist; it presupposes and relies on the very
    certainty it tries to undermine.

    This is more practical than you realize. There are people who actually
    believe that the world is only 6,000 years old. What the fuck, right?
    But if you've ever talked with one of them, you know that they're
    fucking impossible to have what you consider a 'reasonable' discussion
    with. It's not like they don't have answers for everything, it[']s
    just that those answers don't make any fucking sense to you. It[']s
    the sort of gibberish that makes you want to scream. The problem is
    that you don't even play the game by the same goddamn rules. You're
    both certain of your positions, because those positions are logically
    derived from the worldview each of you endorses as your starting
    point, and you both look at each other's foundations and say,
    "Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about?" You don't even know
    how you would go about convincing them that you're right and they're
    wrong; you don't even agree on a method by which to do that.

    If you flew to some part of the world where they'd never heard of an
    airplane or even a bird, how the fuck could you convince them you
    flew? They don't even know what that means. They would have all sorts
    of questions, and would consider your answers nonsensical or magical.
    When a non-believer is told that God exists, he reacts in the same
    way; also, a believer when he is told there is no God.

    So everything we believe about the world is built on some sort of
    foundation. Sure, that foundation can change, but there is always
    something there at the base, and it is that base that enables us to
    talk about the world. Not everyone has the same base you do, and that
    has to be okay. Just know that some of your beliefs are just as
    unsupported as everyone else's. It's just the way it is, bro.

    Yes -- and to me, that's a perfect illustration of why experiments are
    relevant in the first place! More often than not, the only reason we
    need experiments is that we're not smart enough. After the experiment
    has been done, if we've learned anything worth knowing at all, then
    hopefully we've learned why the experiment wasn't necessary to begin
    with -- why it wouldn't have made sense for the world to be any other

    like or the behaviour that will preserve a democracy. For if they did,

Just saw on reddit a perfect accidental metaphor: jakeredfield posted this
in r/gaming:

    For the people that have no played Portal yet, be warned, there may be
    spoilers up ahead for you.

    So anyway, I am a huge fan of Portal, I love everything about the
    game. I bought it upon release and have played through it multiple
    times. My friends aren't as big of gamers as me so it took them some
    time to get their hands on Portal. My one friend didn't have a
    computer capable of running Portal so I let him play on mine.

    I pulled up a chair besides him and eagerly watched him play then
    entire time. He loved the game. I expected him to. It's an awesome
    game. But here comes the WTF part...(SPOILERS AHEAD)

    He go to the part at the last puzzle, right before GlaDOS tries to
    kill you in the fire. So then, my friend is like, "Oh, so it's one of
    those games where you die at the end. Haha, it was a good game." And
    then he immediately shuts it down. I just sat there. Shocked. In awe.
    I couldn't believe what I just saw. He turns to me and goes, "Good
    game, I'd play that again."

    This is the part where I just hit him and yell, "IT WASN'T OVER YET!"
    He was so confused. He loaded it back up to that part and couldn't
    figure it out. I then pointed it out to him what he needed to do from
    there. He eventually fully finished the game.

    Imagine what would have happened if I wasn't there? How many other
    people do you think only experienced the game up to this part, because
    they didn't have someone tell them?

What makes it even more perfect is this reply by Aleitheo:

    So rather than try to see if he could live or even just die in the
    fire he turned off the game before he even saw the "ending"?

    Often a person uses some folk proverb to explain a behavioral event
    even though, on an earlier occasion, this same person used a directly
    contradictory folk proverb to explain the same type of event. For
    example, most of us have heard or said, "look before you leap." Now
    there’s a useful, straightforward bit of behavioral advice—except that
    I vaguely remember admonishing on occasion, "he who hesitates is
    lost." And "absence makes the heart grow fonder" is a pretty clear
    prediction of an emotional reaction to environmental events. But then
    what about "out of sight, out of mind"? And if "haste makes waste,"
    why do we sometimes hear that "time waits for no man"? How could the
    saying "two heads are better than one" not be true? Except that "too
    many cooks spoil the broth." If I think "it’s better to be safe than
    sorry," why do I also believe "nothing ventured, nothing gained"? And
    if "opposites attract," why do "birds of a feather flock together"? I
    have counseled many students to "never to put off until tomorrow what
    you can do today." But I hope my last advisee has never heard me say
    this, because I just told him, "cross that bridge when you come to
    it."

    The enormous appeal of clichés like these is that, taken together as
    implicit "explanations" of behavior, they cannot be refuted. No matter
    what happens, one of these explanations will be cited to cover it. No
    wonder we all think we are such excellent judges of human behavior and
    personality. We have an explanation for anything and everything that
    happens. Folk wisdom is cowardly in the sense that it takes no risk
    that it might be refuted.

ETA: Should have included the subsequent paragraph:

    That folk wisdom is "after the fact" wisdom, and that it actually is
    useless in a truly predictive sense, is why sociologist Duncan Watts
    titled one of his books: Everything Is Obvious—Once You Know the
    Answer (2011). Watts discusses a classic paper by Lazarsfeld (1949) in
    which, over 60 years ago, he was dealing with the common criticism
    that "social science doesn’t tell us anything that we don’t already
    know." Lazarsfeld listed a series of findings from a massive survey of
    600,000 soldiers who had served during World War II; for example, that
    men from rural backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of
    service than soldiers from city backgrounds. People tend to find all
    of the survey results to be pretty obvious. In this example, for
    instance, people tend to think it obvious that rural men would have
    been used to harsher physical conditions and thus would have adapted
    better to the conditions of military life. It is likewise with all of
    the other findings—people find them pretty obvious. Lazarsfeld then
    reveals his punchline: All of the findings were the opposite of what
    was originally stated. For example, it was actually the case that men
    from city backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of
    service than soldiers from rural backgrounds. The last part of the
    learning exercise is for people to realize how easily they would have
    explained just the opposite finding. In the case of the actual
    outcome, people tend to explain it (when told of it first) by saying
    that they expected it because city men are used to working in crowded
    conditions and under hierarchical authority. They never realize how
    easily they would have concocted an explanation for exactly the
    opposite finding.

    The mere fact that it is possible to frame a question does not make it

A fable:

    In Persia many centuries ago, the Sufi mullah or holy man Nasruddin
    was arrested after preaching in the great square in front of the
    Shah's palace. The local clerics had objected to Mullah Nasruddin's
    unorthodox teachings, and had demanded his arrest and execution as a
    heretic. Dragged by palace guards to the Shah's throne room, he was
    sentenced immediately to death.

    As he was being taken away, however, Nasruddin cried out to the Shah:
    "O great Shah, if you spare me, I promise that within a year I will
    teach your favourite horse to sing!"

    The Shah knew that Sufis often told the most outrageous fables, which
    sounded blasphemous to many Muslims but which were nevertheless
    intended as lessons to those who would learn. Thus he had been tempted
    to be merciful, anyway, despite the demands of his own religious
    advisors. Now, admiring the audacity of the old man, and being a
    gambler at heart, he accepted his proposal.

    The next morning, Nasruddin was in the royal stable, singing hymns to
    the Shah's horse, a magnificent white stallion. The animal, however,
    was more interested in his oats and hay, and ignored him. The grooms
    and stablehands all shook their heads and laughed at him. "You old
    fool", said one. "What have you accomplished by promising to teach the
    Shah's horse to sing? You are bound to fail, and when you do, the Shah
    will not only have you killed - you'll be tortured as well, for
    mocking him!"

    Nasruddin turned to the groom and replied: "On the contrary, I have
    indeed accomplished much. Remember, I have been granted another year
    of life, which is precious in itself. Furthermore, in that time, many
    things can happen. I might escape. Or I might die anyway. Or the Shah
    might die, and his successor will likely release all prisoners to
    celebrate his accession to the throne".

    "Or...". Suddenly, Nasruddin smiled. "Or, perhaps, the horse will
    learn to sing".

The original source of this fable seems to be lost to time.

    It is now clear to us what, in the year 1812, was the cause of the
    destruction of the French army. No one will dispute that the cause of
    the destruction of Napoleon's French forces was, on the one hand,
    their advance late in the year, without preparations for a winter
    march, into the depths of Russia, and, on the other hand, the
    character that the war took on with the burning of Russian towns and
    the hatred of the foe aroused in the Russian people. But then not only
    did no one foresee (what now seems obvious) that this was the only way
    that could lead to the destruction of an army of eight hundred
    thousand men, the best in the world and led by the best generals, in
    conflict with a twice weaker Russian army, inexperienced and led by
    inexperienced generals; not only did no one foresee this, but all
    efforts on the part of the Russians were constantly aimed at hindering
    the one thing that could save Russia, and, on the part of the French,
    despite Napoleon's experience and so-called military genius, all
    efforts were aimed at extending as far as Moscow by the end of summer,

    I have met people who exaggerate the differences [between the morality
    of different cultures], because they have not distinguished between
    differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For
    example, one man said to me, "Three hundred years ago people in
    England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule
    of Human Nature or Right Conduct?" But surely the reason we do not
    execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we
    did-if we really thought that there were people going about who had
    sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him
    in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or
    drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if
    anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy quislings did.
    There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is
    simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge
    not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing
    them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man
    humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed

    In the autumn of 1939, Ludwig Wittgenstein and his young Cambridge
    student and friend Norman Malcolm were walking along the river when
    they saw a newspaper vendor's sign announcing that the Germans had
    accused the British government of instigating a recent attempt to
    assassinate Hitler. When Wittgenstein remarked that it wouldn't
    surprise him at all if it were true, Malcolm retorted that it was
    impossible because "the British were too civilized and decent to
    attempt anything so underhand, and . . . such an act was incompatible
    with the British 'national character'." Wittgenstein was furious. Some
    five years later, he wrote to Malcolm:

        "Whenever I thought of you I couldn't help thinking of a
        particular incident which seemed to me very important. . . . you
        made a remark about 'national character' that shocked me by its
        primitiveness. I then thought: what is the use of studying
        philosophy if all that it does for you is to enable you to talk
        with some plausibility about some abstruse questions of logic,
        etc., if it does not improve your thinking about the important
        questions of everyday life, if it does not make you more
        conscientious than any . . . journalist in the use of the
        DANGEROUS phrases such people use for their own ends."

    Suppose we find a society which lacks our understanding of human
    physiology, and that speaks a language just like English, except for
    one curious family of idioms. When they are tired they talk of being
    beset by fatigues, of having mental fatigues, muscular fatigues,
    fatigues in the eyes and fatigues of the the spirit. Their sports lore
    contains such maxims as 'too many fatigues spoils your aim' and 'five
    fatigues in the legs are worth ten in the arms'. When we encounter
    them and tell them of our science, they want to know what fatigues
    are. They have been puzzling over such questions as whether
    numerically the same fatigue can come and go and return, whether
    fatigues have a definite location in matter and space and time,
    whether fatigues are identical with some physical states or processes
    or events in their bodies, or are made of some sort of stuff. We can
    see that they are off to a bad start with these questions, but what
    should we tell them? One thing we can tell them is that there simply
    are no such things as fatigues - they have a confused ontology. We can
    expect them to retort: 'You don't think there are fatigues? Run around
    the block a few times and you'll know better! There are many things
    your science might teach us, but the non-existence of fatigues isn't

    "Why do you read so much?"

    Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a
    few feet away, regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger
    and said, "Look at me and tell me what you see."

    keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be

    strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman.
    Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold
    me to some slaver’s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of
    Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are
    expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years.
    My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life
    is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king and my
    repulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the
    honor of my House, wouldn’t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be
    too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to
    think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of
    my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has
    his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind… and a
    mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its

    After I spoke at the 2005 "Mathematics and Narrative" conference in
    Mykonos, a suggestion was made that proofs by contradiction are the
    mathematician's version of irony. I'm not sure I agree with that: when
    we give a proof by contradiction, we make it very clear that we are
    discussing a counterfactual, so our words are intended to be taken at
    face value. But perhaps this is not necessary. Consider the following
    passage.

        There are those who would believe that every polynomial equation
        with integer coefficients has a rational solution, a view that
        leads to some intriguing new ideas. For example, take the equation
        x² - 2 = 0. Let p/q be a rational solution. Then (p/q)² - 2 = 0,
        from which it follows that p² = 2q². The highest power of 2 that
        divides p² is obviously an even power, since if 2^k is the highest
        power of 2 that divides p, then 2^2k is the highest power of 2
        that divides p². Similarly, the highest power of 2 that divides
        2q² is an odd power, since it is greater by 1 than the highest
        power that divides q². Since p² and 2q² are equal, there must
        exist a positive integer that is both even and odd. Integers with
        this remarkable property are quite unlike the integers we are
        familiar with: as such, they are surely worthy of further study.

    I find that it conveys the irrationality of √2 rather forcefully. But
    could mathematicians afford to use this literary device? How would a
    reader be able to tell the difference in intent between what I have
    just written and the following superficially similar passage?

        There are those who would believe that every polynomial equation
        has a solution, a view that leads to some intriguing new ideas.
        For example, take the equation x² + 1 = 0. Let i be a solution of
        this equation. Then i² + 1 = 0, from which it follows that i² =
        -1. We know that i cannot be positive, since then i² would be
        positive. Similarly, i cannot be negative, since i² would again be
        positive (because the product of two negative numbers is always
        positive). And i cannot be 0, since 0² = 0. It follows that we
        have found a number that is not positive, not negative, and not
        zero. Numbers with this remarkable property are quite unlike the
        numbers we are familiar with: as such, they are surely worthy of
        further study.

    often disastrous as a basis for public policy, science, and law.
    Rather, what I'm saying is that we must be wary of any /individual/'s
    ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited,
    like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the
    stimulation coming into its dendrites to 'decide' whether to fire a
    pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn't very smart. But if you
    put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an
    emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single
    neuron.

    In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing:
    finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds,
    usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to
    produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when
    self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put
    individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can
    use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all
    individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to
    interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good
    reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why
    it's so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity
    within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth.

    A person is said to exhibit rational irrationality when it is
    instrumentally rational for him to be epistemically irrational. An
    instrumentally rational person chooses the best strategies to achieve
    his goals. An epistemically irrational person ignores and evades
    evidence against his beliefs, holds his beliefs without evidence or
    with only weak evidence, has contradictions in his thinking, employs
    logical fallacies in belief formation, and exhibits characteristic
    epistemic vices such as closed-mindedness. Epistemically irrational
    political beliefs can reinforce one’s self-image; boost one’s
    self-esteem; make one feel noble, smart, superior, safe, or
    comfortable; and can help achieve conformity with the group and thus
    facilitate social acceptance. Thus, epistemic irrationality can be
    instrumentally rational.

    If I falsely believe the road I am crossing is free of cars, I might
    die. So I have a strong incentive to form beliefs about the road in a
    rational way. However, if I falsely believe that import quotas are
    good for the economy, this has no directly harmful effects. (On the
    contrary, the belief can have significant instrumental value. It might
    make me feel patriotic; serve my xenophobia; serve as an outlet to
    rationalize, sublimate, or redirect racist attitudes; or help me
    pretend to have solidarity with union workers.) … Epistemic
    rationality is hard and takes self-discipline.

    When it comes to politics, individuals have every incentive to indulge
    their irrational impulses. Demand for irrational beliefs is like
    demand for most other goods. The lower the cost, the more will be
    demanded. The cost to the typical voter of voting in epistemically
    irrational ways is nearly zero. The cost of overcoming bias and
    epistemic irrationality is high. The psychological benefit of this
    irrationality is significant. Thus, voters demand a high amount of
    epistemic irrationality.

    On some pitch black mornings, hearing what I knew was a cold wind
    howling outside, I might think, "Well, it is certainly comfortable in
    this bed, and maybe it wouldn't hurt if I just skipped practicing
    to-day." But my response to this was not to draw on something called
    will power, to insult or threaten myself, but to take a longer look at
    my life, to extend my vision, to think about the whole of my
    experience, to reconnect present and future, and quite specifically,
    to ask myself, "Do you like playing the cello or not? Would you like
    to play it better or not?" When I put the matter this way I could see
    that I enjoyed playing the cello more than I enjoyed staying in bed.
    So I got up. If, as sometimes happened or happens, I do stay in bed,
    not sleeping, not really thinking, but just not getting up, it is not
    because will power is weak but because I have temporarily become
    disconnected, so to speak, from the wholeness of my life. I am living
    in that Now that some people pursue so frantically, that gets harder
    to find the harder we look for it.

    To sum up: it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe
    anything upon insufficient evidence.

    If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or
    persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which
    arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and
    the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards
    as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without
    disturbing it--the life of that man is one long sin against mankind.

    ... "But," says one, "I am a busy man; I have no time for the long
    course of study which would be necessary to make me in any degree a
    competent judge of certain questions, or even able to understand the
    nature of the arguments."

    One of the most serious problems with modern "management" is that the
    incentives are all wrong. Imagine that I hire a programmer and pay him
    by the line of code. This idea has been so thoroughly debunked that it
    is nearly impossible to write out the consequences without sounding
    cliché. Yet it happens all the time: Companies promote "Architects"
    who are evaluated by the weight of their "architecture." The result is
    stultifying and demoralizing. The architect does not work to
    facilitate the programmer's work, he works to produce evidence of his
    contribution in the form of frameworks, standards, and software
    process.

    So, how are most managers evaluated? By the amount of "managing" they
    do, as measured by the amount of process they impose on their team.
    Evaluating a manager by the amount of managing they do is exactly the
    same thing as evaluating a programmer by the amount of code they
    write. And it produces results like you describe, where the manager
    works to produce evidence of their management in the form of processes
    and decisions from the top down, rather than facilitating the work
    actually being done.

    People can learn to look you in the eyes even when they're lying to
    you. But it's kind of like a fake smile; there are involuntary muscles
    up there. If you know what you're looking for, you can still tell. But
    what does it mean if they're looking you in the eyes and they mean it?
    It means that, at least in that moment, they're doing what they really
    believe is right. That's the definition of integrity.

    That part is easy. That's not the surprising thing.

    The surprising thing, to me, was that someone can have integrity and
    still be completely evil. It's kind of obvious in retrospect; the
    super-villain in an action movie can always look the hero in the eye,
    and he always does, just to prove it. He has integrity. Evil with
    integrity is more respectable, somehow, than plain evil. All it takes

    ...some people requested that I be prohibited from studying. One time
    they achieved it through a very holy and simple mother superior who
    believed that studying would get me in trouble with the Inquisition
    and ordered me not to do it. I obeyed her for the three months that
    she was in office in as far as I did not touch a book, but as far as
    absolutely not studying, this was not in my power. [...] Even the
    people I spoke to, and what they said to me, gave rise to thousands of
    reflections. What was the source of all the variety of personality and
    talent I found among them, since they were all one species? [...]
    Sometimes I would pace in front of the fireplace in one of our large
    dormitories and notice that, though the lines of two sides were
    parallel and its ceiling level, to our vision it appears as though the
    lines are inclined toward each other and the ceiling is lower in the
    distance than it is nearby. From this it can be inferred that the
    lines of our vision run straight, but not parallel, to form the figure
    of a pyramid. And I wondered if that was the reason that the ancients
    questioned whether the earth was a sphere or not. Because although it
    seemed so, their vision might have deceived them, showing concave
    shapes where there were none. [...] Once I saw two girls playing with
    a top, and hardly had I seen the movement and the shape when I began,
    in my insane way, to consider the easy movement of the spherical shape
    and how long the momentum, once established, remained independent of
    its original cause, the distant hand of the girl. Not content with
    this I had flour brought and sprinkled on the floor in order to
    discover whether the spinning top would describe perfect circles or
    not. It turned out that they were not perfect circles but spirals that
    lost their circular shape to the degree that the top lost momentum.

Rule I

    We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both
    true and sufficient to explain their appearances.

    To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain,
    and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with
    simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.

Rule II

    Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible,
    assign the same causes.

    As to respiration in a man and in a beast; the descent of stones in
    Europe and in America; the light of our culinary fire and of the sun;
    the reflection of light in the earth, and in the planets.

Rule III

    The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intensification nor
    remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies
    within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal
    qualities of all bodies whatsoever.

    For since the qualities of bodies are only known to us by experiments,
    we are to hold for universal all such as universally agree with
    experiments; and such as are not liable to diminution can never be
    quite taken away. We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence for
    the sake of dreams and vain fictions of our own devising; nor are we
    to recede from the analogy of Nature, which is wont to be simple, and
    always consonant to itself. . .

Rule IV

    In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions inferred
    by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true,
    notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, till
    such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made
    more accurate, or liable to exceptions.

    This rule we must follow, that the argument of induction may not be
    evaded by hypotheses.

    High above the mountaintops, where only distance bars,

    The truth has left its footprints in the dust between the stars.

    We may watch and study or may shudder and deny,

    Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the sky.

    By stem and root and branch we trace, by feather, fang and fur,

    How the living things that are descend from things that were.

    The moss, the kelp, the zebrafish, the very mice and flies,

    These tiny, humble, wordless things--how shall they tell us lies?

    We are kin to beasts; no other answer can we bring.

    The truth has left its fingerprints on every living thing.

    Remember, should you have to choose between them in the strife,

    Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote life.

    And we who listen to the stars, or walk the dusty grade,

    Or break the very atoms down to see how they are made,

    Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand.

    The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.

    Deep in flower and in flesh, in star and soil and seed,

    The truth has left its living word for anyone to read.

    So turn and look where best you think the story is unfurled.

    The Three Virtues of a Programmer:

        Laziness - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce
        overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving
        programs that other people will find useful, and document what you
        wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.

        Impatience - The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy.
        This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs,
        but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.

        Hubris - Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for.
        Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that
        other people won't want to say bad things about.

    Suppose I think, after doing my accounts, that I have a large balance
    at the bank. And suppose you want to find out whether this belief of
    mine is "wishful thinking." You can never come to any conclusion by
    examining my psychological condition. Your only chance of finding out
    is to sit down and work through the sum yourself. When you have
    checked my figures, then, and then only, will you know whether I have
    that balance or not. If you find my arithmetic correct, then no amount
    of vapouring about my psychological condition can be anything but a
    waste of time. If you find my arithmetic wrong, then it may be
    relevant to explain psychologically how I came to be so bad at my
    arithmetic, and the doctrine of the concealed wish will become
    relevant — but only after you have yourself done the sum and
    discovered me to be wrong on purely arithmetical grounds. It is the
    same with all thinking and all systems of thought. If you try to find
    out which are tainted by speculating about the wishes of the thinkers,
    you are merely making a fool of yourself. You must first find out on
    purely logical grounds which of them do, in fact, break down as
    arguments. Afterwards, if you like, go on and discover the
    psychological causes of the error.

    ... People usually don't know why they vote for the candidates they
    choose to vote for, and are not particularly good at assessing how
    something influenced that vote -- let alone how some hypothetical
    future event would influence them.

    ...if you ask voters, it turns out that some will tell you that they
    would be more likely, and a somewhat larger number will tell you that
    they'll be less likely, to vote for someone with a Trump endorsement.
    Hey, reporters: don't believe those polls! You can take it as a
    measure of what respondents think about Trump, if you care about such
    things, but there's no reason to believe that this kind of
    self-reporting about vote choice is meaningful at all, and it
    shouldn't be included in stories about a Trump endorsement as if it
    was meaningful.

    reporters to use in many cases, but remember: what polling tells you
    for sure is only what people will say if they're asked a question by a

    What really matters is:-

        Always try to use the language so as to make quite clear what you
        mean and make sure your sentence couldn't mean anything else.

        Always prefer the plain direct word to the long, vague one. Don't
        implement promises, but keep them.

        Never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean
        "More people died" don't say "Mortality rose."

        In writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want
        us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of
        telling us a thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be
        terrified. Don't say it was "delightful"; make us say "delightful"
        when we've read the description. You see, all those words
        (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying
        to your readers, "Please will you do my job for me."

        Don't use words too big for the subject. Don't say "infinitely"
        when you mean "very"; otherwise you'll have no word left when you
        want to talk about something really infinite.

    ...a good way of thinking about minimalism [about truth] and its
    attractions is to see it as substituting the particular for the
    general. It mistrusts anything abstract or windy. Both the relativist
    and the absolutist are impressed by Pilate's notorious question 'What
    is Truth?', and each tries to say something useful at the same high
    and vertiginous level of generality. The minimalist can be thought of
    turning his back on this abstraction, and then in any particular case
    he prefaces his answer with the prior injunction: you tell me. This
    does not mean, 'You tell me what truth is.' It means, 'You tell me
    what the issue is, and I will tell you (although you will already
    know, by then) what the truth about the issue consists in.' If the
    issue is whether high tide is at midday, then truth consists in high
    tide being at midday... We can tell you what truth amounts to, if you
    first tell us what the issue is.

    There is a very powerful argument for minimalism about truth, due to
    the great logician Gottlob Frege. First, we should notice the
    transparency property of truth. This is the fact that it makes no
    difference whether you say that it is raining, or it is true that it
    is raining, or true that it is true that it is raining, and so on
    forever. But if 'it is true that' introduced some substantial, robust
    property of a judgment, how could this be so? Consider, for example, a
    pragmatism that attempts some equation between truth and utility. Then
    next to the judgment 'it is raining' we might have 'it is useful to
    believe that it is raining.' But these are entirely different things!
    To assess the first we direct our attention to the weather. To assess
    the second we direct our attention to the results of believing
    something about the weather - a very different investigation.

    Let us return to Pilate. Where does minimalism about truth leave him?
    It suggests that when he asked this question, he was distracting
    himself and his audience from his real job, which was to find out
    whether to uphold certain specific historical charges against a
    defendant. Thus, if I am innocent, and I come before a judge, I don't
    want airy generalities about the nature of truth. I want him to find
    that I did not steal the watch if I did not steal the watch. I want
    him to rub his nose in the issue. I want a local judgment about a
    local or specific event, supposed to have happened in a particular
    region of time and space.

    In a society in which the narrow pursuit of material self-interest is
    the norm, the shift to an ethical stance is more radical than many
    people realize. In comparison with the needs of people starving in
    Somalia, the desire to sample the wines of the leading French
    vineyards pales into insignificance. Judged against the suffering of
    immobilized rabbits having shampoos dripped into their eyes, a better
    shampoo becomes an unworthy goal. An ethical approach to life does not
    forbid having fun or enjoying food and wine, but it changes our sense
    of priorities. The effort and expense put into buying fashionable
    clothes, the endless search for more and more refined gastronomic
    pleasures, the astonishing additional expense that marks out the
    prestige car market in cars from the market in cars for people who
    just want a reliable means to getting from A to B, all these become
    disproportionate to people who can shift perspective long enough to
    take themselves, at least for a time, out of the spotlight. If a
    higher ethical consciousness spreads, it will utterly change the

    The last project that I worked on with [Richard Feynman] was in

    that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps
    rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record
    shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit
    such "punctuated equilibrium," so Richard and I decided to look more
    closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went
    out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model
    of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck

    discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my

    One in four Americans has an opinion about an imaginary debt plan

    Americans would profess to have an opinion about a policy that did not
    exist. They found one in four voters to do just that.

    Panetta-Burns’ nonexistent policy proposals were supported by 8
    percent and opposed by 17 percent of the voters surveyed.
    Simpson-Bowles’ real policy proposals had stronger favorables, with 23
    percent support and 16 percent opposition.

(In a thread where people were asked whether or not they had a religious
experience of "feeling God"):

    I had something similar to feeling God, I suppose, except it was in
    essence the exact opposite. I was in a forest one summer, and I looked
    up at the sunlight shining through the leaves, and suddenly it felt
    like I could see each and every individual leaf in the forest and
    trace the path of each photon that poured through them, and I remember
    thinking over and over, in stunned amazement, "the world is
    sufficient. The world is sufficient."

    I'd never thought much about religion before that, but that experience
    made me realize that the material world was entire orders of magnitude
    more beautiful than any of the tawdry religious fantasies people came
    up with, and it felt unspeakably tragic that anyone would ever reject
    this, our most incredible universe, for spiritual pipe-dreams. In a
    way, you might say I felt the lack of god, and it felt like glory.

    I am reminded of a commentary on logic puzzles of a certain kind; it
    was perhaps in a letter to Martin Gardner, reprinted in one of his
    books. The puzzles are those about getting about on an island where
    each native either always tells the truth or always lies. You reach a
    fork in the road, for example, and a native is standing there, and you
    want to learn from him, with one question, which way leads to the
    village. The "correct" question is "If I asked you if the left way led
    to the village, would you say yes?" But why should the native’s
    concept of lying conform to our own logical ideas? If the native is a
    liar, it means he wants to fool you, and your logical trickery will
    not work. The best you can do is say something like "Did you hear they
    are giving away free beer in the village today?" and see which way the
    native runs. You follow him, even if he says something like "Ugh, I
    hate beer!" since then he probably really is lying.

    Lastly, there is an attitude not unknown in the crisis against which I
    should particularly like to protest. I should address my protest
    especially to those lovers and pursuers of Peace who, very
    short-sightedly, have occasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude
    which is impatient of these preliminary details about who did this or
    that, and whether it was right or wrong. They are satisfied with
    saying that an enormous calamity, called War, has been begun by some
    or all of us; and should be ended by some or all of us. To these
    people this preliminary chapter about the precise happenings must
    appear not only dry (and it must of necessity be the driest part of
    the task) but essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell these
    people that they are wrong; that they are wrong upon all principles of
    human justice and historic continuity: but that they are specially and
    supremely wrong upon their own principles of arbitration and
    international peace.

    citizens no longer settle their quarrels by private violence; and that
    nations should no longer settle theirs by public violence. They are
    always telling us that we no longer fight duels; and need no longer
    wage wars. In short, they perpetually base their peace proposals on
    the fact that an ordinary citizen no longer avenges himself with an
    axe. But how is he prevented from revenging himself with an axe? If he
    hits his neighbour on the head with the kitchen chopper, what do we

    that people always do things that make sense to them. Hard as it is to
    believe with all the hurting out there, almost nobody hurts others
    just to be a jerk. So if you want to change human behavior on a grand

    The inhabitants of Florence in 1494 or Athens in 404 BCE could be
    forgiven for concluding that optimism just isn't factually true. For
    they knew nothing of such things as the reach of explanations or the
    power of science or even laws of nature as we understand them, let
    alone the moral and technological progress that was to follow when the
    Enlightenment got under way. At the moment of defeat, it must have
    seemed at least plausible to the formerly optimistic Athenians that
    the Spartans might be right, and to the formerly optimistic
    Florentines that Savonarola might be. Like every other destruction of
    optimism, whether in a whole civilization or in a single individual,
    these must have been unspeakable catastrophes for those who had dared
    to expect progress. But we should feel more than sympathy for those
    people. We should take it personally. For if any of those earlier
    experiments in optimism had succeeded, our species would be exploring
    the stars by now, and you and I would be immortal.

    he be giving me the same advice, or would it totally change his

    One of my mentors once gave me a list of obvious things to check when

        environment probably isn't the same as your production
        environment.

    When I was halfway through my Ph.D. I formulated a hypothesis: The
    proximate challenge that keeps you from graduating is that you have to
    write a thesis. But the ultimate challenge to getting your Ph.D. is
    this: You somehow have to learn to understand, deep down, that all
    your romantic notions about the Ph.D. are bunk, that you will be
    exactly the same person on the day after you get it that you were the
    day before, and that you need to stop waiting for the day when you
    feel like a god and just write something down and get on with life.

    It may take you years to accept this, and it may drive you to drink,
    but after you get to that point you can graduate.

    Only then will you be able to live with the fact that your thesis
    looks like crap to you. Your thesis will always look like crap to you.
    Either you will have figured out absolutely everything and your thesis
    will look incredibly boring to you, because you've moved on, or --
    vastly more likely -- your thesis will look woefully incomplete
    because, geez, there is so much that you couldn't figure out, and
    you're just so stupid!

    Or, most likely of all, you will think both of these things at the
    same time.

    Similarly: Being the world's foremost expert on a particular
    scientific problem is a lot less exciting in real life than it seems
    in the movies. In fact, being on the frontier of science feels like
    being totally, hopelessly lost and confused. Why this came as a

    In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them.
    When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then,
    if you want to describe the thing you have been visualizing you
    probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit
    it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use
    words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to
    prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job
    for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning.
    Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and
    get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations.

    The reason you can't rigidly separate positive from normative
    economics is that you can't rigidly separate claims of fact from
    claims of value in general. Human language is too laden with thick
    concepts that mix the two. The claim that someone is a "slut" or a
    "bitch", for example, melds together factual claims about a woman's
    behavior with a lot of deeply embedded normative concepts about what
    constitutes appropriate behavior for a woman. The claim that financial
    markets are "efficient" is both an effort to describe their operation
    and a way of valorizing them. The idea of a "recession" or "full
    employment" or "potential output" all embed certain ideas about what
    would constitute a normal arrangement of human economic activity (...)
    You could try to rigorously purge your descriptions of the economy of
    anything that vaguely smells of a thick moral concept, but you'd find
    yourself operating with an impoverished vocubulary unable to describe
    human affairs in any kind of reasonable way.

    [Hitler] has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life.
    Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all
    "progressive" thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire
    nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view
    of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the
    military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with
    soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a
    substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do.
    Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional
    strength, knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety,
    short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common
    sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and
    self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades.

    However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are
    psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life.
    The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarized version of
    Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power
    by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism,
    and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to people "I offer
    you a good time," Hitler has said to them "I offer you struggle,
    danger and death," and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his
    feet.

    The Patrician steepled his hands and looked at Vimes over the top of
    them.

    "Let me give you some advice, Captain," he said.

    "Yes, sir?"

    "It may help you make some sense of the world."

    "Sir."

    "I believe you find life such a problem because you think there are
    the good people and the bad people," said the man. "You're wrong, of
    course. There are, always and only, the bad people, but some of them
    are on opposite sides. "

    He waved his thin hand towards the city and walked over to the window.

    "A great rolling sea of evil," he said, almost proprietorially.
    "Shallower in some places, of course, but deeper, oh, so much deeper
    in others. But people like you put together little rafts of rules and
    vaguely good intentions and say, this is the opposite, this will
    triumph in the end. Amazing!" He slapped Vimes good-naturedly on the
    back.

    "Down there," he said, "are people who will follow any dragon, worship
    any god, ignore any iniquity. All out of a kind of humdrum, everyday
    badness. Not the really high, creative loathesomeness of the great
    sinners, but a sort of mass-produced darkness of the soul. Sin, you
    might say, without a trace of originality. They accept evil not
    because they say yes, but because they don't say no. I'm sorry if this
    offends you,'' he added, patting the captain's shoulder, "but you
    fellows really need us."

    "Yes, sir?" said Vimes quietly.

    "Oh, yes. We're the only ones who know how to make things work. You
    see, the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the
    bad people. And you're good at that, I'll grant you. But the trouble
    is that it's the only thing you're good at. One day it's the ringing
    of the bells and the casting down of the evil tyrant, and the next
    it's everyone sitting around complaining that ever since the tyrant
    was overthrown no-one's been taking out the trash. Because the bad
    people know how to plan. It's part of the specification, you might
    say. Every evil tyrant has a plan to rule the world. The good people
    don't seem to have the knack."

    "Maybe. But you're wrong about the rest!" said Vimes. "It's just
    because people are afraid, and alone-" He paused. It sounded pretty
    hollow, even to him.

    He shrugged. "They're just people," he said. "They're just doing what
    people do. Sir."

    Lord Vetinari gave him a friendly smile. "Of course, of course," he
    said. "You have to believe that, I appreciate. Otherwise you'd go
    quite mad. Otherwise you'd think you're standing on a feather-thin
    bridge over the vaults of Hell. Otherwise existence would be a dark
    agony and the only hope would be that there is no life after death. I
    quite understand."

    (...)

    After a while he made a few pencil annotations to the paper in front
    of him and looked up.

    "I said," he said, "that you may go."

    Vimes paused at the door.

    "Do you believe all that, sir?" he said. "About the endless evil and
    the sheer blackness?"

    "Indeed, indeed," said the Patrician, turning over the page. "It is
    the only logical conclusion."

    "But you get out of bed every morning, sir?"

    "Hmm? Yes? What is your point?"

Long quote to make a simple point, but relevant. (Context: this is from a
Star Wars novel, so it's fiction.)

    A death hollow is a low point where the heavier-than-air toxic gases
    that roll downslope from the volcanoes can pool.

    The corpse of a hundred-kilo tusker lay just within its rim, its snout
    only a meter below the clear air that could have saved it. Other
    corpses littered the ground around it: rot crows and jacunas and other
    small scavengers I didn't recognize, lured to their deaths by the
    jungle's false promise of an easy meal.

    I said something along these lines to Nick. He laughed and called me a
    Balawai fool.

    "There's no false promise," he'd said. "There's no promise at all. The
    jungle doesn't promise. It exists. That's all. What killed those
    little ruskakks wasn't a trap. It was just the way things are."

    Nick says that to talk of the jungle as a person-to give it the
    metaphoric aspect of a creature, any creature-that's a Balawai thing.
    That's part of what gets them killed out here.

    It's a metaphor that shades the way you think: talk of the jungle as a
    creature, and you start treating it like a creature. You start
    thinking you can outsmart the jungle, or trust it, overpower it or
    befriend it, deceive it or bargain with it.

    And then you die.

    "Not because the jungle kills you. You get it? Just because it is what
    it is." These are Nick's words. "The jungle doesn't do anything. It's
    just a place. It's a place where many, many things live... and all of
    them die. Fantasizing about it - pretending it's something it's not -
    is fatal. That's your free life lesson for the day," he told me. "Keep
    it in mind."

    It is very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if

-- Confucius, allegedly (quoted in The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed)

Edit: The rationality relevance might need some explanation. The way I've
seen this aphorism used is this: it's sometimes hard to distinguish
between a task that's achievable but very difficult (and that it therefore
might make sense to spend time/effort on), and a task that is impossible
(and thus is a complete waste of time/effort).

If you spend some time searching for the cat in the dark room, you might
not find it. Is that because finding it is difficult (after all, this is
what you might quite plausibly expect, if you assume that the cat is
there), or because the cat is not there and you're wasting your time?

    Moral language persuades best when opinions are not yet formed, which
    is why writers of children’s literature can get away with saying
    things like, "Mr. Billings was an awful, horrible man with a heart of
    stone." This sounds like a line from a children’s book because it
    employs persuasive methods that, though appropriate for children,
    would insult the intelligence of most adult readers.

    Most moral discourse is the conversational equivalent of children’s
    literature. Disputants speak to one another—or, rather, at one
    another—as if their interlocutors failed to pay adequate attention on
    the day elementary morality was explained. Unaware of the projective
    nature of value, they marvel at their opponents’ blindness, their
    utter failure to see what is so perfectly obvious. Not knowing what
    else to do, they scold their opponents as if they were children, and
    scold them as if they were belligerent children when they fail to
    respond the first time.

    What to do about this? Take a cue from good writers. Stick to the
    facts. Keep evaluative language to a minimum, and get rid of the most
    overtly judgmental, moralistic language.

    'One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and
    he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of
    biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that
    he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats
    in the front row, if they would also like a biscuit. A few students
    took a biscuit.

    "Nice biscuit, don't you think," said Korzybski, while he took a 2nd
    one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white
    paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On
    it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words "Dog Cookies."

    The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them
    wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out
    of the lecture hall to the toilet.

    "You see," Korzybski remarked, "I have just demonstrated that people
    don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former
    is often outdone by the taste of the latter."'

I think of this as a rationalist parable and not so much a quote. It has a
lot of personal resonance since I often had dog biscuits with my tea when
I was younger.

    acquisition of such knowledge constitutes education. Speaking of this
    reminds me of a forceful statement made by a professor of agronomy in
    my freshman year in college. Whatever knowledge I gained in his course
    has departed completely, but I remember how, with World War I as his

    "Because they were hypocrites," Finkle-McGraw said, after igniting his
    calabash and shooting a few tremendous fountains of smoke into the
    air, "the Victorians were despised in the late twentieth century. Many
    of the persons who held such opinions were, of course, guilty of the
    most nefandous conduct themselves, and yet saw no paradox in holding
    such views because they were not hypocrites themselves-they took no
    moral stances and lived by none."

    "So they were morally superior to the Victorians-" Major Napier said,
    still a bit snowed under. "-even though-in fact, because-they had no
    morals at all." There was a moment of silent, bewildered head-shaking
    around the copper table.

    "We take a somewhat different view of hypocrisy," Finkle-McGraw
    continued. "In the late-twentieth-century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite
    was someone who espoused high moral views as part of a planned
    campaign of deception-he never held these beliefs sincerely and
    routinely violated them in privacy. Of course, most hypocrites are not
    like that. Most of the time it's a spirit-is-willing, flesh-is-weak
    sort of thing."

    "That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier
    said, working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in
    espousing that code."

    "Of course not," Finkle-McGraw said. "It's perfectly obvious, really.
    No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct.
    Really, the difficulties involved-the missteps we make along the way
    are what make it interesting. The internal, and eternal, struggle,
    between our base impulses and the rigorous demands of our own moral
    system is quintessentially human. It is how we conduct ourselves in
    that struggle that determines how we may in time be judged by a higher

    Once again, we are saddled with a Stone Age moral psychology that is

    wrong because, once upon a time, this was a useful way to think. It is
    no more, though it remains natural as ever. We love our respective
    moral senses. They are as much a part of us as anything. But if we are

    As a rule, people judged themselves according to their intentions and

    to be these things and were almost entirely blind to the fact that
    others wanted the same. Intentions were all important when it came to

    In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them,

    Idealists of all schools, aristocrats and bourgeois, theologians and
    physicians, politicians and moralists, religionists, philosophers, or
    poets, not forgetting the liberal economists - unbounded worshippers
    of the ideal, as we know - are much offended when told that man, with
    his magnificent intelligence, his sublime ideas, and his boundless
    aspirations, is, like all else existing in the world, nothing but
    matter, only a product of vile matter.

    We may answer that the matter of which materialists speak, matter
    spontaneously and eternally mobile, active, productive, matter
    chemically or organically determined and manifested by the properties
    or forces, mechanical, physical, animal, and intelligent, which
    necessarily belong to it - that this matter has nothing in common with
    the vile matter of the idealists. The latter, a product of their false
    abstraction, is indeed a stupid, inanimate, immobile thing, incapable
    of giving birth to the smallest product, a caput mortuum, an ugly
    fancy in contrast to the beautiful fancy which they call God; as the
    opposite of this supreme being, matter, their matter, stripped by that
    constitutes its real nature, necessarily represents supreme
    nothingness.

    "The important thing," said Miss Treason, "is to stay the passage of

    are the worst, take it from me."

    "I don’t think I understand—" Tiffany began.

    "Try not to fart, in a nutshell."

    "In a nutshell I imagine it would be pretty unpleasant!" said Tiffany
    nervously. She couldn’t believe she was being told this.

    "This is no joking matter," said Miss Treason. "The human body only
    has so much air in it. You have to make it last. One plate of beans
    can take a year off your life. I have avoided rumbustiousness all my
    days. I am an old person and that means what I say is wisdom!" She
    gave the bewildered Tiffany a stern look. "Do you understand, child?"

    Tiffany’s mind raced. Everything is a test! "No," she said. "I’m not a
    child and that’s nonsense, not wisdom!"

    The stern look cracked into a smile. "Yes," said Miss Treason. "Total

About the intersection of math and politics through the mind of a child,
Bob Murphy relates this story about his six-year-old son Clark:

    Clark: Daddy why can’t there be a biggest number?

    Bob: Because no matter how big a number is, there is always a bigger
    number.

    Clark (puzzled): Why?

    Bob: OK, let’s say a guy comes up to me and says, "Hey, I know the
    biggest number!" Then I would say, "Oh yeah, what is it?" And the guy
    would tell me, "It’s a billion billion." But then I would just add 1
    to it, and say, "A ha, a billion billion and 1 is a bigger number. So
    you made a mistake when you said you thought of the biggest number."

    Clark (after a pause): What guy are you talking about?

    Bob: Just any guy. I’m saying, if anybody tries to think of the
    biggest number, I’ll always be able to do that trick-where I add 1 to
    it-so they can’t do it. They’ll always lose.

    Clark: What if a girl asks you?

    [I ran through the same thing with a girl asking me...]

    Clark: OK I want to tell the story!

    Bob: Sure go ahead.

    Clark: So what if a guy came up to me and said, "Hey Clark, I know the
    biggest number! It’s 100 billion!" Then I would say, "No, 100 billion
    and 1 is bigger! You’re wrong!"

    Bob: Right, good job. So he didn’t really think of the biggest number
    after all, did he?

    Clark: No.

    Bob: And you can always do that.

    Clark: OK let me tell it again with Sam [name possibly changed--a kid
    from his class].

    Bob: OK.

    Clark: So what if Sam came up to me and said, "Hey Clark, I know the
    biggest number. It’s 50 googol." But I would say, "No Sam you’re
    wrong! 50 googol and 1 is bigger!" But Sam gets mad so he would start
    shouting and say, "I DID TOO THINK OF THE BIGGEST NUMBER CLARK!!"

And I know we're not supposed to quote ourselves, but you rarely get an
opportunity to use a line like this:

    I guess you already tried explaining to Clark that the cardinality of
    the natural numbers is invariant under transformations of largest
    number proponent?

    Despite the difficulty of exact Bayesian inference in complex
    mathematical models, the essence of Bayesian reasoning is frequently
    used in everyday life. One example has been immortalized in the words
    of Sherlock Holmes to his friend Dr. Watson: "How often have I said to
    you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
    however improbable, must be the truth?" (Arthur Conan Doyle, The Sign
    of Four, 1890, Ch. 6). This reasoning is actually a consequence of
    Bayesian belief updating, as expressed in Equation 4.4. Let me
    re-state it this way: "How often have I said to you that when p(D|θ_i
    ) = 0 for all i!=j, then, no matter how small the prior p(θ_j ) 0 is,
    the posterior p(θ_j |D) must equal one." Somehow it sounds better the
    way Holmes said it.

    Practically anything can go faster than Disc light, which is lazy and

    king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir
    instantaneously. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary
    particles—kingons, or possibly queons—that do this job, but of course
    succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an
    anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery

    academics and teachers, philosophers and prophets, poets and pop stars
    - as so many potential rogues and knoves, each out to exploit the
    universal human hunger for social status. He would therefore

    The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke remarked that "any
    sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".
    Clarke was referring to the fantastic inventions we might discover in
    the future or in our travels to advanced civilizations. However, the
    insight also applies to self-perception. When we turn our attention to
    our own minds, we are faced with trying to understand an unimaginably
    advanced technology. We can't possibly know (let alone keep track of)
    the tremendous number of mechanical influences on our behavior because
    we inhabit an extraordinarily complicated machine. So we develop a
    shorthand, a belief in the causal efficacy of our conscious thoughts.
    We believe in the magic of our own causal agency.

    "The general method that Wittgenstein does suggest is that of ’shewing
    that a man has supplied no meaning for certain signs in his
    sentences’.

    I can illustrate the method from Wittgenstein’s later way of
    discussing problems. He once greeted me with the question: ‘Why do
    people say that it was natural to think that the sun went round the
    earth rather than that the earth turned on its axis? I replied: ‘I
    suppose, because it looked as if the sun went round the earth.’
    ‘Well,’ he asked, ‘what would it have looked like if it had looked as
    if the earth turned on its axis?’

    This question brought it out that I had hitherto given no relevant
    meaning to ‘it looks as if’ in ‘it looks as if the sun goes round the
    earth’.

    My reply was to hold out my hands with the palms upward, and raise
    them from my knees in a circular sweep, at the same time leaning
    backwards and assuming a dizzy expression. ‘Exactly!’ he said."

Commentary: Reading this made me realize that many religions genuinely are
different from each other. Christianity is genuinely different from
Judaism, Islam is genuinely different from Christianity, Hinduism is
genuinely different from all three. It's religious people who are the same
everywhere; not the same as each other, obviously, but drawn from the same
distribution. Is this true of atheistic humanists? Of transhumanists?
Could you devise an experiment to test whether it was so, would you bet on
the results of that experiment? Will they say the same of LessWrongers,
someday? And if so, what's the point?

Now that I think on it, though, there might be a case for scientists being
drawn from a different distribution, or computer programmers, or for that
matter science fiction fans (are those all the same distributions as each
other, I wonder?). It's not really hopeless.

    When we were first drawn together as a society, it had pleased God to
    enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines, which we
    once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others, which we had
    esteemed errors, were real truths. From time to time He has been
    pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been
    improving, and our errors diminishing.

    Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this
    progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theological
    knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of
    faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and

    Slogans like "practice random acts of kindness" feel good and are easy
    to put into practice. But if we don’t take our activism more seriously
    than that, our motive is probably a desire to feel good about
    ourselves, to help ourselves or those close to us, or to act out our
    self-identity. The endpoint of authentic compassion is a desire to do
    the most good that one can, to be as effective as possible in creating
    a world with less suffering and destruction and more joy. Figuring out
    how we can do the most good takes careful thought over a long period
    of time, and it means moving into new and possibly uncomfortable areas
    of advocacy. But the importance of taking our activism seriously and
    approaching it from this utilitarian perspective cannot be overstated.
    It will mean a difference between life and death, between happiness

    DP: What effect did all this realism have on your life?

    H: I would spend hours aimlessly wandering the streets, kicking large
    stones and shouting, "I refute you thus!" It's embarrassing to recall.

    DP: There was worse, wasn't there Hilary?

    H: I can't deny it, don. (Audience gasps.) Instead of going to work I
    would sit at home fondling ashtrays and reading voraciously about
    converging scientific theories. I kept a copy of "Hitler: A Study in

    The seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the
    ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in
    them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions
    what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and
    demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is
    fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty
    of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning
    the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he
    reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content,
    attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he
    performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling
    into either prejudice or leniency.

    Were it possible to trace the succession of ideas in the mind of Sir
    Isaac Newton, during the time that he made his greatest discoveries, I
    make no doubt but our amazement at the extent of his genius would a
    little subside. But if, when a man publishes his discoveries, he
    either through a design, or through habit, omit the intermediary steps
    by which he himself arrived at them, it is no wonder that his
    speculations confound them, and that the generality of mankind stand
    amazed at his reach of thought. If a man ascend to the top of a
    building by the help of a common ladder, but cut away most of the
    steps after he has done with them, leaving only every ninth of tenth
    step, the view of the ladder, in the condition which he has pleased to
    exhibit it, gives us a prodigious, but unjust view of the man who
    could have made use of it. But if he had intended that any body should
    follow him, he should have left the ladder as he constructed it, or
    perhaps as he found it, for it might have been a mere accident that
    threw it in his way... I think that the interests of science have
    suffered by the excessive admiration and wonder with which several
    first rate philosophers are considered, and that an opinion of the
    greater equality of mankind, in point of genius, and power of
    understanding, would be of real service in the present age." - Joseph

    All scientists despise the ideology of 'breakthroughs' --- I mean the
    belief that science proceeds from one revelation to another, each one
    opening up a new world of understanding and advancing still farther a
    sharp line of demarcation between what is true and what is false.
    Everyone actually engaged in scientific research knows that this way
    of looking at things is altogether misleading, and that the frontier
    between understanding and bewilderment is rather like the plasma
    membrane of a cell as it creeps over its substratum, a pushing forward
    here, a retraction there --- an exploratory probing that will
    eventually move forward the whole body of the cell... in real life,

    When people talk about the importance of democracy, it is never
    democracy as it has ever actually functioned, with the politicians
    that have actually been elected, and the policies that have actually
    been implemented. It is always democracy as people imagine it will
    operate once they succeed in electing "the right people" — by which
    they mean, people who agree almost completely with their own views,
    and who are consistent and incorruptible in their implementation of
    the resulting policies.

Considering the above quote can be used to criticize nearly any popular
political position I don't think it is inherently mind-killing. Also since
we all agree democracy is a good thing this isn't even very political. The

    "Stay, 'tis just a figure!" Root laughed rather winningly, reaching

    "I am called an Alchemist. Within living memory, Daniel, everyone who
    studied what I—and you—study was called by that name. And most persons

    more vigorous order of knowledge that is associated with your club."

    As I came in here I saw a map, lately taken from this house, burning
    in the fire. The map was empty, for it depicted the ocean—most likely,
    a part of it where no man has ever been. A few lines of latitude were
    ruled across that vellum void, and some legendary isles drawn in, with
    great authority, and where the map-maker could not restrain himself he
    drew phantastickal monsters. That map, to me, is Alchemy. It is good
    that it burnt, and fitting that it burnt tonight, the eve of a
    Revolution that I will be so bold as to call my life's work. In a few
    years Mr. Hooke will learn to make a proper chronometer, finishing
    what Mr. Huygens began thirty years ago, and then the Royal Society
    will draw maps with lines of longitude as well as latitude, giving us
    a grid— what we call a Cartesian grid, though 'twas not his idea—and
    where there be islands, we will rightly draw them. Where there are
    none, we will draw none, nor dragons, nor sea-monsters—and that will

    I always thought I really hated getting email. It turns out that I was
    not a good reporter of my own actual behavior, which is something
    you’ll hear quite a bit if you follow psychological research. (For
    example, something like 75% of Americans will report they voted for
    President Obama, which disagrees quite a bit with the ballot box. They
    do this partially because they misremember their own behavior and
    partially because they like to been seen as the type of person who
    voted for the winner. 99% of geeks will report never having bought
    anything as a result of an email. They do this because they
    misremember their own behavior and partially because they believe that
    buying stuff from "spam" is something that people with AOL email
    addresses do, and hence admitting that they, too, can be marketed to
    will cause them to lose status. The AppSumo sumo would be a good deal

M. Mitchell Waldrop on a meeting between physicists and economists at the
Santa Fe Institute:

    ...as the axioms and theorems and proofs marched across the overhead
    projection screen, the physicists could only be awestruck at [the
    economists'] mathematical prowess — awestruck and appalled. They had
    the same objection that [Brian] Arthur and many other economists had
    been voicing from within the field for years. "They were almost too
    good," says one young physicist, who remembers shaking his head in
    disbelief. "lt seemed as though they were dazzling themselves with
    fancy mathematics, until they really couldn't see the forest for the
    trees. So much time was being spent on trying to absorb the
    mathematics that I thought they often weren't looking at what the
    models were for, and what they did, and whether the underlying
    assumptions were any good. In a lot of cases, what was required was
    just some common sense. Maybe if they all had lower IQs, they'd have
    been making some better models."

    flaws but does not include the use of Monte Carlo simulations among
    them. He himself is a strong proponent of these simulations. Monte
    Carlo simulations are simply the way we do the math with uncertain
    quantities. Abandoning Monte Carlos because of the failures of the

    2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 - 2 =3, and 5 - 3 = 2 are not four facts, but
    four different ways of looking at one fact. Furthermore, that fact is
    not a fact of arithmetic, to be taken on faith and memorized like
    nonsense syllables. It is a fact of nature, which children can
    discover for themselves, and rediscover or verify for themselves as
    many times as they need or want to.

    The fact is this:

    ***** -- *** **

    If you have before you a group of objects--coins or stones, for
    example---that looks like the group on the left, then you can make it
    into two groups that look like the ones on the right. Or--and this is
    what the two-way arrow means---if you have two groups that look like
    the ones on the right, you can make them into a group that looks like
    the one on the left.

    This is not a fact of arithmetic, but a fact of nature. It did not
    become true only when human beings invented arithmetic. It has nothing
    to do with human beings. It is true all over the universe. One doesn't
    have to know any arithmetic to discover or verify it. An infant
    playing with blocks or a dog pawing at sticks might do that operation,
    though probably neither of them would notice that he had done it; for
    them, the difference between ***** and *** ** would be a difference
    that didn't make any difference. Arithmetic began (and begins) when
    human beings began to notice and think about this and other numerical
    facts of nature.

    resist adding a comment about GPS devices. Any navigation tool -- GPS
    device, map, compass, sextant, whatever -- only works if you are using
    the navigation tool to relate yourself to the surrounding landscape.
    And you should never trust maps, GPS devices, compasses, or any tool
    if it contradicts what you're seeing in the surrounding landscape. I
    own a top-notch brand of GPS device, I got a top-quality map to go
    inside it, and when I checked the map against a landscape I knew well,
    I found error after error (which is true with all maps, by the way;
    one of the reasons I like paper maps is that I can make notations on

    The necessity for marking our classes has brought with it a bias for

    There is no feat of irrelevance that people will not perform quite
    easily in this way; there is no class, however accidental, to which
    they will not at once ascribe deeply distinctive qualities. The
    seventh sons of seventh sons have remarkable powers of insight; people
    with a certain sort of ear commit crimes of violence; people with red
    hair have souls of fire; all democratic socialists are trustworthy
    persons; all people born in Ireland have vivid imaginations and all
    Englishmen are clods; all Hindoos are cowardly liars; all curly-haired
    people are good-natured; all hunch-backs are energetic and wicked, and
    all Frenchmen eat frogs. Such stupid generalisations have been
    believed with the utmost readiness, and acted upon by great numbers of
    sane, respectable people. And when the class is one's own class, when
    it expresses one of the aggregations to which one refers one's own
    activities, then the disposition to divide all qualities between this
    class and its converse, and to cram one's own class with every

    "Tell me, Eben: how is’t, d’you think, that the planets are moved in
    their courses?"

    "Why, said Ebenezer, "’tis that the cosmos is filled with little
    particles moving in vortices, each of which centers on a star; and
    ‘tis the subtle push and pull of these particles in our solar vortex
    that slides the planets along their orbs - is’t not?"

    "So saith Descartes," Burlingame smiled. "And d’you haply recall what
    is the nature of light?"

    "If I have’t right," replied Ebenezer, "’tis an aspect of the vortices
    - of the press of inward and outward forces in ‘em. The celestial fire
    is sent through space from the vortices by this pressure, which
    imparts a transitional motion to little light globules - "

    "Which Renatus kindly hatched for that occasion," Burlingame
    interrupted. "And what’s more he allows his globules both a
    rectilinear and a rotatary motion. If only the first occurs when the
    globules smite our retinae, we see white light; if both, we see color.
    And if this were not magical enough - mirabile dictu! - when the
    rotatory motion surpasseth the rectilinear, we see blue; when the
    reverse, we see red; and when the twain are equal, we see yellow. What
    fantastical drivel!"

    Who first called Reason sweet, I don't know. I suspect that he was a
    man with very few responsibilities, no children to rear, and no
    payroll to meet. An anchorite with heretical tendencies, maybe, or the
    idle youngest son of a wealthy Athenian. The dictates of Reason are
    often difficult to figure out, rarely to my liking, and profitable
    only by what seems a happy but remarkably unusual accident. Mostly,
    Reason brings bad news, and bad news of the worst sort, for, if it is
    truly the word of Reason, there is no denying it or weaseling out of
    its demands without simply deciding to be irrational. Thus it is that
    I have discovered, and many others, I notice, have also discovered,
    all sorts of clever ways to convince myself that Reason is "mere"
    Reason, powerful and right, of course, but infinitely outnumbered by
    reasons, my reasons.

    The ultimate theological question is: ‘Where does the Sun go at
    night?’.

    The answer that so many civilisations agreed for so long was: ‘The Sun
    is driven by one of the gods, and at night it goes under the Earth to
    fight a battle. There is at least some risk that the god will lose
    this battle, and so the Sun may not rise tomorrow’. It’s something the
    human race understood was a cast iron fact before they knew how to
    cast iron. It survived as the working model twenty-five times longer
    than the four hundred years we’ve understood the Earth goes around the
    Sun.

    But even as light is opposed by darkness, science and reason have
    their enemies. Superstition and belief in magic are as old as man
    himself; for the intransigence of facts and our limitations in
    controlling them can be powerfully hard to take. Add to this the
    reflection that we are in an age when it is popular to distrust
    whatever is seen as the established view or the Establishment, and it
    is no wonder that anti-rational attitudes and doctrines are mustering
    so much support. Still, we can understand what encourages the
    anti-rationalist turn without losing our zeal for opposing it. A
    current Continuing Education catalogue offers a course description,
    under the heading "Philosophy", that typifies the dark view at its
    darkest: "Children of science that we are, we have based our cultural
    patterns on logic, on the cognitive, on the verifiable. But more and
    more there has crept into current research and study the haunting
    suggestion that there are other kinds of knowledge unfathomable by our
    cognition, other ways of knowing beyond the limits of our logic, which
    are deserving of our serious attention." Now "knowledge unfathomable
    by our cognition" is simply incoherent, as attention to the words
    makes clear. Moreover, all that creeps is not gold. One wonders how

    Whether a mathematical proposition is true or not is indeed

    [Instrumentalism about science] has a long and rather sorry
    philosophical history: most contemporary philosophers of science
    regard it as fairly conclusively refuted. But I think it’s easier to
    see what’s wrong with it just by noticing that real science just isn’t
    like this. According to instrumentalism, palaeontologists talk about
    dinosaurs so they can understand fossils, astrophysicists talk about
    stars so they can understand photoplates, virologists talk about
    viruses so they can understand NMR instruments, and particle
    physicists talk about the Higgs Boson so they can understand the LHC.

Prompted by the discussion of Sam Harriss idea that science should provide

    so, because men care not in that subject what be truth, as a thing
    that crosses no man's ambition, profit, or lust. For I doubt not, but
    if it had been a thing contrary to any man's right of dominion, or to
    the interest of men that have dominion, that the three angles of a
    triangle should be equal to two angles of a square, that doctrine

    I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard
    ground.

    So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:

    Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned

    With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.

    Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.

    Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.

    A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,

    A formula, a phrase remains, -- but the best is lost.

    The answers quick keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,

    They are gone. They have gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled

    Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.

    More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.

    Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave

    Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;

    Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.

    I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.

    Take the bettors in the racetrack experiment. Thirty seconds before

    ans self-assured. The act of making a final decision--in this case, of
    buying a ticket--had been the critical factor. Once a stand had been

    Suppose we know someone's objective and also know that half the time
    that person correctly figures out how to achieve it and half the time
    he acts at random. Since there is generally only one right way of
    doing things (or perhaps a few) but very many wrong ways, the
    "rational" behavior can be predicted but the "irrational" behavior
    cannot. If we predict the person's behavior on the assumption that he
    is rational, we will be right half the time. If we assume he is
    irrational, we will almost never be right, since we still have to
    guess which irrational thing he will do. We are better off assuming he
    is rational and recognizing that we will sometimes be wrong. To put
    the argument more generally, the tendency to be rational is the
    consistent (and hence predictable) element in human behavior. The only
    alternative to assuming rationality (other than giving up and assuming
    that human behavior cannot be understood and predicted) would be a
    theory of irrational behavior - a theory that told us not only that
    someone would not always do the rational thing but also which
    particular irrational thing he would do. So far as I know, no
    satisfactory theory of that sort exists.

    It cannot have escaped philosophers' attention that our fellow
    academics in other fields--especially in the sciences--often have
    difficulty suppressing their incredulous amusement when such topics as
    Twin Earth, Swampman, and Blockheads are posed for apparently serious
    consideration. Are the scientists just being philistines, betraying
    their tin ears for the subtleties of philosophical investigation, or
    have the philosophers who indulge in these exercises lost their grip
    on reality?

    These bizarre examples all attempt to prove one "conceptual" point or
    another by deliberately reducing something underappreciated to zero,
    so that What Really Counts can shine through. Blockheads hold
    peripheral behavior constant and reduce internal structural details
    (and--what comes to the same thing--intervening internal processes)
    close to zero, and provoke the intuition that then there would be no
    mind there; internal structure Really Counts. Manthra is more or less
    the mirror-image; it keeps internal processes constant and reduces
    control of peripheral behavior to zero, showing, presumably, that
    external behavior Really Doesn't Count. Swampman keeps both future
    peripheral dispositions and internal states constant and reduces
    "history" to zero. Twin Earth sets internal similarity to maximum, so
    that external context can be demonstrated to be responsible for
    whatever our intuitions tell us. Thus these thought experiments mimic
    empirical experiments in their design, attempting to isolate a crucial
    interaction between variables by holding other variables constant. In
    the past I have often noted that a problem with such experiments is
    that the dependent variable is "intuition"--they are intuition
    pumps--and the contribution of imagination in the generation of
    intuitions is harder to control than philosophers have usually
    acknowledged.

    But there is also a deeper problem with them. It is child's play to
    dream up further such examples to "prove" further conceptual points.
    Suppose a cow gave birth to something that was atom-for-atom
    indiscernible from a shark. Would it be a shark? What is the
    truth-maker for sharkhood? If you posed that question to a biologist,
    the charitable reaction would be that you were making a labored
    attempt at a joke. Suppose an evil demon could make water turn solid
    at room temperature by smiling at it; would demon-water be ice? Too
    silly a hypothesis to deserve a response. All such intuition pumps
    depend on the distinction spelled out by McLaughlin and
    O'Leary-Hawthorne between "conceptual" and "reductive" answers to the
    big questions. What I hadn't sufficiently appreciated in my earlier
    forthright response to Jackson is that when one says that the
    truth-maker question requires a conceptual answer, one means an answer
    that holds not just in our world, or all nomologically possible
    worlds, but in all logically possible worlds. Smiling demons,
    cow-sharks, Blockheads, and Swampmen are all, some philosophers think,
    logically possible, even if they are not nomologically possible, and
    these philosophers think this is important. I do not. Why should the
    truth-maker question cast its net this wide? Because, I gather,
    otherwise its answer doesn't tell us about the essence of the topic in
    question. But who believes in real essences of this sort nowadays? Not
    I.

    The human understanding is no dry light, but receives an infusion from

    impatience of research; sober things, because they narrow hope; the
    deeper things of nature, from superstition; the light of experience,
    from arrogance and pride, lest his mind should seem to be occupied
    with things mean and transitory; things not commonly believed, out of

    But when we have these irrational beliefs, these culturally coded
    assumptions, running so deep within our community and movement, how do
    we actually change that? How do we get people to further question
    themselves when they’ve already become convinced that they’re a
    rational person, a skeptic, and have moved on from irrationality,
    cognitive distortion and bias?

    Well I think what we need to do is to change the fundamental structure
    and values of skepticism. We need to build our community and movement
    around slightly different premises.

    As it has stood in the past, skepticism has been predicated on a
    belief in the power of the empirical and rational. It has been based
    on the premise that there is an empirical truth, and that it is
    knowable, and that certain tools and strategies like science and logic
    will allow us to reach that truth. In short, the "old guard"
    skepticism was based on a veneration of the rational. But the
    veneration of certain techniques or certain philosophies creates the
    problematic possibility of choosing to consider certain conclusions or
    beliefs to BE empirical and rational and above criticism, particularly
    beliefs derived from the "right" tools, and even more dangerously, to
    consider oneself "rational".

    ...

    I believe that in order to be able to question our own beliefs as well
    as we question those of others, we need to restructure skepticism
    around awareness of human limitation, irrationality and flaws. Rather
    than venerating the rational, and aspiring to become some kind of
    superhuman fully rational vulcan minds, we need to instead create a
    more human skepticism, built around understanding how belief operates,
    how we draw conclusions, and how we can cope with the human
    limitations. I believe we need to remove the focus from aspiring
    towards ridding ourselves of the irrational, and instead move the
    focus towards understanding how this irrationality operates and why we
    believe all the crazy things we believe. We need to position as our
    primary aspiration not the achievement of a perfect comprehending
    mind, but instead an ability to maintain constant hesitation and
    doubt, to always always ALWAYS second-guess our positions and
    understand that they’re being created through a flawed mind, from
    flawed perceptions.

    Science and reason are excellent tools to allow us to cope with being
    crazy, irrational human beings, but it CANNOT allow us to transcend
    that. The instant we begin to believe that we have become A Skeptic, A
    Rational Person, that is when we’ve fucked up, that is when we stop
    practicing skepticism, stop keeping an eye out for our mistakes, and
    begin to imagine our irrational perceptions as perfect rational
    conclusions. It’s only by building a skepticism based on the practice
    of doubt, rather than the state of Skeptic, that we’ll truly be able
    to be move on from our assumptions.

    study of the motions and interactions that underlie historical change.
    [...] The process of the historical transition will then be recognized
    to be unlike what the whig historian seems to assume - much less like
    the procedure of a logical argument and perhaps much more like the
    method by which a man can be imagined to work his way out of a
    "complex". It is a process which moves by mediations and those
    mediations may be provided by anything in the world - by men’s sins or
    misapprehensions or by what we can only call fortunate conjunctures.
    Very strange bridges are used to make the passage from one state of
    things to another; we may lose sight of them in our surveys of general
    history, but their discovery is the glory of historical research.
    History is not the study of origins; rather it is the analysis of all
    the mediations by which the past was turned into our present.

    If a man objects to truths that are all too evident, it is no easy
    task finding arguments that will change his mind. This is proof
    neither of his own strength nor of his teacher's weakness. When
    someone caught in an argument hardens to stone, there is just no more
    reasoning with them.

    "Well, how about this — that man, unlike animals, is a creature who

    "So have I," said Valentine. "But the trouble is that man, or in any
    case the common man, easily overcomes this need for knowledge of his.
    It seems to me that he doesn't have such a need at all. There's a need
    to understand, but knowledge is not required for that. The God
    hypothesis, for instance, gives one an unparalleled ability to
    understand absolutely everything, while discovering absolutely
    nothing... Give a person a highly simplified model of the world and
    interpret any event on the basis of this simplified model. Such an
    approach required no knowledge. A few memorized formulas plus some

    When I became convinced that the Universe is natural — that all the
    ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul,
    into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, the joy of
    freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was
    flooded with light, and all the bolts, and bars, and manacles became
    dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf, or a slave. There was for me
    no master in all the wide world — not even in infinite space. I was
    free — free to think, to express my thoughts — free to live to my own
    ideal — free to live for myself and those I loved — free to use all my
    faculties, all my senses — free to spread imagination’s wings — free
    to investigate, to guess and dream and hope — free to judge and
    determine for myself — free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds,
    all the "inspired" books that savages have produced, and all the
    barbarous legends of the past — free from the popes and priests — free
    from all the "called" and "set apart" — free from sanctified mistakes
    and holy lies — free from the fear of eternal pain — free from the
    winged monsters of the night — free from devils, ghosts, and gods. For
    the first time I was free. There were no prohibited places in all the
    realms of thought — no air, no space, where fancy could not spread her
    painted wings — no chains for my limbs — no lashes for my back — no
    fires for my flesh — no master’s frown or threat — no following
    another’s steps — no need to bow, or cringe, or crawl, or utter lying
    words. I was free. I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously, faced all
    worlds.

    And then my heart was filled with gratitude, with thankfulness, and
    went out in love to all the heroes, the thinkers who gave for the
    liberty of hand and brain — for the freedom of labor and thought — to
    those who fell in the fierce fields of war, to those who died in
    dungeons bound with chains — to those who proudly mounted scaffold’s
    stairs — to those whose bones were crushed, whose flesh was scarred
    and torn — to those by fire consumed — to all the wise, the good, the
    brave of every land, whose thoughts and deeds have given freedom to
    the sons of men. And then I vowed to grasp the torch that they had
    held, and hold it high, that light might conquer darkness still.

    Witching was turning out to be mostly hard work and really short on
    magic of the zap!-glingle-glingle-glingle variety. There was no school
    and nothing that was exactly like a lesson. But it wasn’t wise to try
    to learn witching all by yourself, especially if you had a natural
    talent. If you got it wrong, you could go from ignorant to cackling in
    a week ...

    When you got right down to it, it was all about cackling. No one ever
    talked about this, though. Witches said things like "You can never be
    too old, too skinny, or too warty," but they never mentioned the
    cackling. Not properly. They watched out for it, though, all the time.

    It was all too easy to become a cackler. Most witches lived by
    themselves (cat optional) and might go for weeks without ever seeing
    another witch.  In those times when people hated witches, they were
    often accused of talking to their cats. Of course they talked to their
    cats. After three weeks without an intelligent conversation that
    wasn’t about cows, you’d talk to the wall. And that was an early sign
    of cackling.

    "Cackling," to a witch, didn’t just mean nasty laughter. It meant your
    mind drifting away from its anchor. It meant you losing your grip. It
    meant loneliness and hard work and responsibility and other people’s
    problems driving you crazy a little bit at a time, each bit so small
    that you’d hardly notice it, until you thought that it was normal to
    stop washing and wear a kettle on your head. It meant you thinking
    that the fact you knew more than anyone else in your village made you
    better than them. It meant thinking that right and wrong were
    negotiable. And, in the end, it meant you "going to the dark," as the
    witches said. That was a bad road. At the end of that road were
    poisoned spinning wheels and gingerbread cottages.

    What stopped this was the habit of visiting. Witches visited other
    witches all the time, sometimes traveling quite a long way for a cup
    of tea and a bun. Partly this was for gossip, of course, because
    witches love gossip, especially if it’s more exciting than truthful.
    But mostly it was to keep an eye on one another.

    Today Tiffany was visiting Granny Weatherwax, who was in the opinion
    of most witches (including Granny herself) the most powerful witch in
    the mountains. It was all very polite. No one said, "Not gone bats,
    then?" or "Certainly not! I’m as sharp as a spoon!" They didn’t need
    to. They understood what it was all about, so they talked of other
    things. But when she was in a mood, Granny Weatherwax could be hard
    work.

    The intellect, as a means for the preservation of the individual,

    the weaker, less robust individuals preserve themselves, since they
    are denied the chance of waging the struggle for existence with horns
    or the fangs of beasts of prey. In man this art of simulation reaches
    its peak: here deception, flattering, lying and cheating, talking
    behind the back, posing, living in borrowed splendor, being masked,
    the disguise of convention, acting a role before others and before
    oneself—in short, the constant fluttering around the single flame of
    vanity is so much the rule and the law that almost nothing is more
    incomprehensible than how an honest and pure urge for truth could make
    its appearance among men. They are deeply immersed in illusions and
    dream images; their eye glides only over the surface of things and
    sees "forms"; their feeling nowhere lead into truth, but contents

On specificity and sneaking on connotations; useful for the liberal-minded
among us:

    I think, with racism and sexism and 'isms' generally, there's a sort
    of confusion of terminology.

    A "Racist1" is someone, who, like a majority of people in this
    society, has subconsciously internalized some negative attitudes about
    minority racial groups. If a Racist1 takes the Implicit Association
    Test, her score shows she's biased against black people, like the
    majority of people (of all races) who took the test. Chances are,
    whether you know it or not, you're a Racist1.

    A "Racist2" is someone who's kind of an insensitive jerk about race.
    The kind of guy who calls Obama the "Food Stamp President." Someone
    you wouldn't want your sister dating.

    A "Racist3" is a neo-Nazi. You can never be quite sure that one day he
    won't snap and kill someone. He's clearly a social deviant.

    People use the word "Racist" for all three things, and I think that's
    the source of a lot of arguments. When people get accused of being
    racists, they evade responsibility by saying, "Hey, I'm not a
    Racist3!" when in fact you were only saying they were Racist1 or
    Racist2. But some of the responsibility is on the accusers too -- if
    you say "That Republican's a racist" with the implication of "a jerk"
    and then backtrack and change the meaning to "vulnerable to
    unconscious bias", then you're arguing in bad faith. Never mind that
    some laws and rules which were meant to protect people from Racist3's
    are in fact deployed against Racist2's.

    It is a chemical process and nothing more. For that matter—we—are
    chemical processes and nothing more. If you deny yourself a useful
    tool simply because it reminds you uncomfortably of your mortality,
    you have uselessly and pointlessly crippled yourself.

    To understand our civilisation, one must appreciate that the extended
    order resulted not from human design or intention but spontaneously:
    it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional and
    largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose
    significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they
    cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by
    means of an evolutionary selection — the comparative increase of
    population and wealth — of those groups that happened to follow them.
    The unwitting, reluctant, even painful adoption of these practices
    kept these groups together, increased their access to valuable
    information of all sorts, and enabled them to be 'fruitful, and
    multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This
    process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.

An excerpt from Wise Man's Fear, by Patrick Rothfuss. Boxing is not safe.

    The innkeeper looked up. "I have to admit I don't see the trouble," he
    said apologetically. "I've seen monsters, Bast. The Cthaeh falls short
    of that."

    "That was the wrong word for me to use, Reshi," Bast admitted. "But I
    can't think of a better one. If there was a word that meant poisonous
    and hateful and contagious, I'd use that."

    Bast drew a deep breath and leaned forward in his chair. "Reshi, the
    Cthaeh can see the future. Not in some vague, oracular way. It sees
    all the future. Clearly. Perfectly. Everything that can possibly come
    to pass, branching out endlessly from the current moment."

    Kvothe raised an eyebrow. "It can, can it?"

    "It can," Bast said gravely. "And it is purely, perfectly malicious.
    This isn't a problem for the most part, as it can't leave the tree.
    But when someone comes to visit..."

    Kvothe's eyes went distant as he nodded to himself. "If it knows the
    future perfectly," he said slowly, "then it must know exactly how a
    person will react to anything it says."

    Bast nodded. "And it is vicious, Reshi."

    Kvothe continued in a musing tone. "That means anyone influenced by
    the Cthaeh would be like an arrow shot into the future."

    "An arrow only hits on person, Reshi." Bast's dark eyes were hollow
    and hopeless. "Anyone influenced by the Cthaeh is like a plague ship
    sailing for a harbor." Bast pointed at the half-filled sheet
    Chronicler held in his lap. "If the Sithe knew that existed, they
    would spare no effort to destroy it. They would kill us for having
    heard what the Cthaeh said."

    "Because anything carrying the Cthaeh's influence away from the
    tree..." Kvothe said, looking down at his hands. He sat silently for a
    long moment, nodding thoughtfully. "So a young man seeking his fortune
    goes to the Cthaeh and takes away a flower. The daughter of the king
    is deathly ill, and he takes the flower to heal her. They fall in love
    despite the fact that she's betrothed to the neighboring prince..."

    Bast stared at Kvothe, watching blankly as he spoke.

    "They attempt a daring moonlight escape," Kvothe continued. "But he
    falls from the rooftops and they're caught. The princess is married
    against her will and stabs the neighboring prince on their wedding
    night. The prince dies. Civil war. Fields burned and salted. Famine.
    Plague..."

    "That's the story of the Fastingsway War," Bast said faintly.

    A common mistake is to suppose that scientists are such admirable
    people that they can be safely entrusted with the ultimate
    responsibility for guiding scientific research. In fact they are no
    more admirable than any other type of worker. Neither selection nor
    self-selection tor a scientific career is based on admirableness.
    Though the conventions and protocols of science enforce on scientists,
    in comparison to astrologers and English professors - and lawyers - a
    high degree of objectivity when they are doing science, it does not
    follow that such individuals can be depended on to be objective policy
    analysts. That is a role for which they are not trained (but is
    anyone?) and that does not impose the constraints that science
    imposes.

    It is neither desirable nor any longer effective to try bullying
    people into accepting the authority of science. Instead, all members
    of the educated public can be invited to participate in science, in
    order to experience the true nature and value of scientific inquiry.
    This does not mean listening to professional scientists tell
    condescending stories about how they have discovered wonderful things,
    which you should believe for reasons that are too difficult for you to
    understand in real depth and detail. Doing science ought to mean
    asking your own questions, making your own investigations, and drawing
    your own conclusions for your own reasons. Of course it will not be
    feasible to advance the "cutting edge" or "frontier" of modern science
    without first acquiring years of specialist training. However, the
    cutting edge is not all there is to science, nor is it necessarily the
    most valuable part of science. Questions that have been answered are
    still worth asking again, so you can understand for yourself how to
    arrive at the standard answers, and possibly discover new answers or
    recover forgotten answers that are valuable.

    Reason is the faculty that identifies and integrates the material
    provided by man’s senses. It is a faculty that man has to exercise by
    choice. Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue
    of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking
    requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one’s
    consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active,
    purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and
    let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any
    chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his
    undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random,

    Suppose you know a golfer's score on day 1 and are asked to predict
    his score on day 2. You expect the golfer to retain the same level of
    talent on the second day, so your best guesses will be "above average"
    for the [better-scoring] player and "below average" for the
    [worse-scoring] player. Luck, of course, is a different matter. Since
    you have no way of predicting the golfers' luck on the second (or any)
    day, your best guess must be that it will be average, neither good nor
    bad. This means that in the absence of any other information, your
    best guess about the players' score on day 2 should not be a repeat of
    their performance on day 1. ...

    The best predicted performance on day 2 is more moderate, closer to
    the average than the evidence on which it is based (the score on day
    1). This is why the pattern is called regression to the mean. The more
    extreme the original score, the more regression we expect, because an
    extremely good score suggests a very lucky day. The regressive
    prediction is reasonable, but its accuracy is not guaranteed. A few of
    the golfers who scored 66 on day 1 will do even better on the second
    day, if their luck improves. Most will do worse, because their luck
    will no longer be above average.

    Now let us go against the time arrow. Arrange the players by their
    performance on day 2 and look at their performance on day 1. You will
    find precisely the same pattern of regression to the mean. ... The
    fact that you observe regression when you predict an early event from
    a later event should help convince you that regression does not have a
    causal explanation.

    As far as I know, Robespierre, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot were
    indeed unusually incorruptible, and I do hate them for this trait.

    Why? Because when your goal is mass murder, corruption saves lives.
    Corruption leads you to take the easy way out, to compromise, to go
    along to get along. Corruption isn't a poison that makes everything
    worse. It's a diluting agent like water. Corruption makes good
    policies less good, and evil policies less evil.

    I've read thousands of pages about Hitler. I can't recall the
    slightest hint of "corruption" on his record. Like Robespierre, Lenin,
    Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot, Hitler was a sincerely murderous fanatic.
    The same goes for many of history's leading villains - see Eric
    Hoffer's classic The True Believer. Sincerity is so overrated. If only

    That's true. But if you actually want to know what's happening in the
    race the increased poll volume makes it clearer not less clear. The
    sense that the polls are "all over the map" is the mistake. You need
    to think of each datapoint as having an associated probability
    distribution and then look at where they overlap. [...] The fact that
    we now have tons of polling that averages out to [a] conclusion means
    the scope for "sampling error" to throw us off is, at this point,
    tiny. One poll showing a lead of the current magnitude would leave us
    with a ton of uncertainty, but a bunch of polls makes the picture
    pretty clear.

    I don't have any previous experience with this sort of thing, but
    judging from what I hear and read, I'm supposed to be asking why all
    this is happening, and why it's happening to me. Honestly, those
    questions are about the farthest thing from my mind.

    Partly, that’s because they aren't hard questions. Why does our world
    have gravity? Why does the sun rise in the East? There are technical
    answers, but the metaphysical answer is simple: that’s how reality
    works. So too here. Only in the richest parts of the rich world of the
    twenty-first century could anyone entertain the thought that we should
    expect long, pain-free lives. Suffering and premature death (an odd
    phrase: what does it mean to call death "premature"?) are constant
    presences in the lives of most of the peoples of the Earth, and were
    routine parts of life for generations of our predecessors in this
    country—as they still are today, for those with their eyes open. Stage
    4 cancers happen to middle-aged men and women, seemingly out of the
    blue, because that's how reality works.

    As for why this is happening to me in particular, the implicit point
    of the question is an argument: I deserve better than this. There are
    two responses. First, I don't—I have no greater moral claim to be free
    from unwanted pain and loss than anyone else. Plenty of people more
    virtuous than I am suffer worse than I have, and some who don't seem
    virtuous at all skate through life with surprising ease. Welcome to
    the world. Once again, it seems to me that this claim arises from the
    incredibly unusual experience of a small class of wealthy
    professionals in the wealthiest parts of the world today. We think we
    live in a world governed by merit and moral desert. It isn't so. Luck,
    fortune, fate, providence—call it what you will, but whatever your
    preferred label, it has far more to do with the successes of the
    successful than what any of us deserves. Aristocracies of the past
    awarded wealth and position based on the accident of birth. Today's
    meritocracies award wealth and position based on the accident of being
    in the right place at the right time. The difference is smaller than
    we tend to think. Once you understand that, it’s hard to maintain a
    sense of grievance in the face of even the ugliest medical news. I’ve
    won more than my share of life's lotteries. It would seem churlish to
    rail at the unfairness of losing this one—if indeed I do lose it:
    which I may not.

    The second response is simpler; it comes from the movie "Unforgiven."
    Gene Hackman is dying, and says to Clint Eastwood: "I don't deserve
    this. To die like this. I was building a house." Eastwood responds:
    "Deserve’s got nothing to do with it."

    That gets it right, I think. It's a messed-up world, upside-down as
    often as it's rightside up. Bad things happen; future plans (that
    house Hackman was building) come to naught. Deserve's got nothing to
    do with it.

    "The spatial anomaly has interacted with the tachyonic radiation in
    the nebula, it's interfering with our sensors. It's impossible to get
    a reading."

    "There's no time - we'll have to take the ship straight through it!"

    "Captain, I advise against this course of action. I have calculated
    the odds against our surviving such an action at three thousand, seven

    your goddamn work."

    to known cases of ships passing through nebulae that are interacting
    with spatial anomalies. There have been approximately two million such
    incidents reported, with only five hundred and forty-two incidents in
    which the ship in question survived intact."

    "And did you at all take into account that ship building technology
    has improved over the past fifty years, and that ours is not
    necessarily an average ship?"

    "Indeed I did, Captain. I weighted the cases differently based on how
    recent they were, and how close the ship in question was in build to
    our own. For example, one of the incidents with a happy ending was
    forty-seven years ago, but their ship was a model roughly five times
    our size. As such, I counted the incident as having twenty-four
    percent of the relevance of a standard case."

    "But what of our ship's moxie? Can you take determination and drive
    and the human spirit into account?"

    "As a matter of fact I can, Captain. In our three-year history
    together, I have observed that both you and this ship manage to beat
    the odds with a measurable regularity. To be exact, we tend to succeed
    twenty-four point five percent more often than the statistics would
    otherwise indicate - and, in fact, that number jumps to twenty-nine
    point two percent specifically in cases where I state the odds against
    our success to three significant digits or greater. I have already
    taken that supposedly 'unknowable' factor into account with my
    calculations."

    "And you expect me to believe that you've memorized all these case
    studies and performed this ridiculously complicated calculation in
    your head within the course of a normal conversation?"

    "Yes. With all due respect to your species, I am not human. While I
    freely admit that you do have greater insight into fields such as
    emotion, interpersonal relations, and spirituality than I do, in the

Hofstadter on the necessary strangeness of scientific explanations:

    It is no accident, I would maintain, that quantum mechanics is so
    wildly counterintuitive. Part of the nature of explanation is that it
    must eventually hit some point where further probing only increases
    opacity rather than decreasing it. Consider the problem of
    understanding the nature of solids. You might wonder where solidity
    comes form. What if someone said to you, "The ultimate basis of this
    brick's solidity is that it is composed of a stupendous number of
    eensy weensy bricklike objects that themselves are rock-solid"? You
    might be interested to learn that bricks are composed of micro-bricks,
    but the initial question - "What accounts for solidity?" - has been
    thoroughly begged. What we ultimately want is for solidity to vanish,
    to dissolve, to disintegrate into some totally different kind of
    phenomenon with which we have no experience. Only then, when we have
    reached some completely novel, alien level will we feel that we have
    really made progress in explaining the top-level phenomenon.

    [...]

    I first saw this thought expressed in the stimulating book Patterns of
    Discovery by Norwood Russell Hanson. Hanson attributes it to a number
    of thinkers, such as Isaac Newton, who wrote, in his famous work
    Opticks: "The parts of all homogeneal hard Bodies which fully touch
    one another, stick together very strongly. And for explaining how this
    may be, some have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging the
    Question." Hanson also quotes James Clerk Maxwell (from an article
    entitled "Atom"): "We may indeed suppose the atom elastic, but this is
    to endow it with the very property for the explanation of which... the
    atomic constitution was originally assumed." Finally, here is a quote
    Hanson provides from Werner Heisenberg himself: "If atoms are really
    to explain the origin of color and smell of visible material bodies,
    then they cannot possess properties like color and smell." So,
    although it is not an original thought, it is useful to bear in mind
    that greeness disintegrates.

    In a class I taught at Berkeley, I did an experiment where I wrote a

    very easy to write a program that will make the right prediction about
    70% of the time. Most people don't really know how to type randomly.
    They'll have too many alternations and so on. There will be all sorts
    of patterns, so you just have to build some sort of probabilistic
    model. Even a very crude one will do well. I couldn't even beat my own
    program, knowing exactly how it worked. I challenged people to try
    this and the program was getting between 70% and 80% prediction rates.
    Then, we found one student that the program predicted exactly 50% of
    the time. We asked him what his secret was and he responded that he

    The fear people have about the idea of adherence to protocol is
    rigidity. They imagine mindless automatons, heads down in a checklist,
    incapable of looking out their windshield and coping with the real
    world in front of them. But what you find, when a checklist is well
    made, is exactly the opposite. The checklist gets the dumb stuff out
    of the way, the routines your brain shouldn’t have to occupy itself
    with (Are the elevator controls set? Did the patient get her
    antibiotics on time? Did the managers sell all their shares? Is
    everyone on the same page here?), and lets it rise above to focus on
    the hard stuff (Where should we land?).

    Here are the details of one of the sharpest checklists I’ve seen, a
    checklist for engine failure during flight in a single-engine Cessna
    airplane—the US Airways situation, only with a solo pilot. It is
    slimmed down to six key steps not to miss for restarting the engine,
    steps like making sure the fuel shutoff valve is in the OPEN position
    and putting the backup fuel pump switch ON. But step one on the list
    is the most fascinating. It is simply: FLY THE AIRPLANE. Because
    pilots sometimes become so desperate trying to restart their engine,
    so crushed by the cognitive overload of thinking through what could
    have gone wrong, they forget this most basic task. FLY THE AIRPLANE.
    This isn’t rigidity. This is making sure everyone has their best shot

    In Munich in the days of the great theoretical physicist Arnold
    Sommerfeld (1868–1954), trolley cars were cooled in summer by two
    small fans set into their ceilings. When the trolley was in motion,
    air flowing over its top would spin the fans, pulling warm air out of
    the cars. One student noticed that although the motion of any given
    fan was fairly random—fans could turn either clockwise or
    counterclockwise—the two fans in a single car nearly always rotated in
    opposite directions. Why was this? Finally he brought the problem to
    Sommerfeld.

    "That is easy to explain," said Sommerfeld. "Air hits the fan at the
    front of the car first, giving it a random motion in one direction.
    But once the trolley begins to move, a vortex created by the first fan

    In some species of Anglerfish, the male is much smaller than the
    female and incapable of feeding independently. To survive he must
    smell out a female as soon as he hatches. He bites into her releasing
    an enzime which fuses him to her permanently. He lives off her blood
    for the rest of his life, providing her with sperm whenever she needs
    it. Females can have multiple males attached. The morale is simple:
    males are parasites, women are sluts. Ha! Just kidding! The moral is
    don't treat actual animal behavior like a fable. Generally speaking,
    animals have no interest in teaching you anything.

    "However, there is something they value more than a man's life: a
    trowel."

    "Why a trowel?"

    "If a bricklayer drops his trowel, he can do no more work until a new
    one is brought up. For months he cannot earn the food that he eats, so
    he must go into debt. The loss of a trowel is cause for much wailing.
    But if a man falls, and his trowel remains, men are secretly relieved.
    The next one to drop his trowel can pick up the extra one and continue
    working, without incurring debt."

    Hillalum was appalled, and for a frantic moment he tried to count how
    many picks the miners had brought. Then he realized. "That cannot be
    true. Why not have spare trowels brought up? Their weight would be
    nothing against all the bricks that go up there. And surely the loss
    of a man means a serious delay, unless they have an extra man at the
    top who is skilled at bricklaying. Without such a man, they must wait
    for another one to climb from the bottom."

    "Ten thousand years' worth of sophistry doesn't vanish overnight,"
    Margit observed dryly. "Every human culture had expended vast amounts
    of intellectual effort on the problem of coming to terms with death.
    Most religions had constructed elaborate lies about it, making it out
    to be something other than it was—though a few were dishonest about
    life, instead. But even most secular philosophies were warped by the
    need to pretend that death was for the best."

    "It was the naturalistic fallacy at its most extreme—and its most
    transparent, but that didn't stop anyone. Since any child could tell
    you that death was meaningless, contingent, unjust, and abhorrent
    beyond words, it was a hallmark of sophistication to believe
    otherwise. Writers had consoled themselves for centuries with smug
    puritanical fables about immortals who'd long for death—who'd beg for
    death. It would have been too much to expect all those who were
    suddenly faced with the reality of its banishment to confess that
    they'd been whistling in the dark. And would-be moral
    philosophers—mostly those who'd experienced no greater inconvenience
    in their lives than a late train or a surly waiter—began wailing about
    the destruction of the human spirit by this hideous blight. We needed
    death and suffering, to put steel into our souls! Not horrible,
    horrible freedom and safety!"

    In 2002, Wizards of the Coast put out Star Wars: The Trading Card Game
    designed by Richard Garfield.

    As Richard modeled the game after a miniatures game, it made use of
    many six-sided dice. In combat, cards' damage was designated by how
    many six-sided dice they rolled. Wizards chose to stop producing the
    game due to poor sales. One of the contributing factors given through
    market research was that gamers seem to dislike six-sided dice in
    their trading card game.

    Here's the kicker. When you dug deeper into the comments they equated
    dice with "lack of skill." But the game rolled huge amounts of dice.
    That greatly increased the consistency. (What I mean by this is that
    if you rolled a million dice, your chance of averaging 3.5 is much
    higher than if you rolled ten.) Players, though, equated lots of dice
    rolling with the game being "more random" even though that contradicts
    the actual math.

    Not long ago a couple across the aisle from me in a Quiet Car talked
    all the way from New York City to Boston, after two people had asked
    them to stop. After each reproach they would lower their voices for a
    while, but like a grade-school cafeteria after the lunch monitor has
    yelled for silence, the volume crept inexorably up again. It was soft
    but incessant, and against the background silence, as maddening as a
    dripping faucet at 3 a.m. All the way to Boston I debated whether it
    was bothering me enough to say something. As we approached our
    destination a professorial-looking man who’d spoken to them twice got

    What does puzzle people – at least it used to puzzle me – is the fact
    that Christians regard faith… as a virtue. I used to ask how on Earth
    it can be a virtue – what is there moral or immoral about believing or
    not believing a set of statements? Obviously, I used to say, a sane
    man accepts or rejects any statement, not because he wants or does not
    want to, but because the evidence seems to him good or bad. If he were
    mistaken about the goodness or badness of the evidence, that would not
    mean he was a bad man, but only that he was not very clever. And if he
    thought the evidence bad but tried to force himself to believe in
    spite of it, that would be merely stupid…

    What I did not see then – and a good many people do not see still –
    was this. I was assuming that if the human mind once accepts a thing
    as true it will automatically go on regarding it as true, until some
    real reason for reconsidering it turns up. In fact, I was assuming
    that the human mind is completely ruled by reason. But that is not so.
    For example, my reason is perfectly convinced by good evidence that
    anesthetics do not smother me and that properly trained surgeons do
    not start operating until I am unconscious. But that does not alter
    the fact that when they have me down on the table and clap their
    horrible mask over my face, a mere childish panic begins inside me. I
    start thinking I am going to choke, and I am afraid they will start
    cutting me up before I am properly under. In other words, I lose my
    faith in anesthetics. It is not reason that is taking away my faith;
    on the contrary, my faith is based on reason. It is my imagination and
    emotions. The battle is between faith and reason on one side and
    emotion and imagination on the other…

    Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of
    holding onto things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your
    changing moods. For moods will change, whatever view your reason
    takes. I know that by experience. Now that I am a Christian, I do have
    moods in which the whole thing looks very improbable; but when I was
    an atheist, I had moods in which Christianity looked terribly
    probable... Unless you teach your moods "where they get off" you can
    never be either a sound Christian or even a sound atheist, but just a
    creature dithering to and fro, with its beliefs really dependent on
    the weather and the state of its digestion. Consequently one must
    train the habit of faith.

-- C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

Caveat: this is not at all how the majority of the religious people that I
know would use the word "faith". In fact, this passage turned out to be
one of the earliest helps in bringing me to think critically about and
ultimately discard my religious worldview.

    When I was at Cornell, I often talked to the people in the psychology
    department. One of the students told me she wanted to do an experiment
    that went something like this – it had been found by others that under
    certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A. She was curious as to
    whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still do A.
    So her proposal was to do the experiment under circumstances Y and see
    if they still did A.

    I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her
    laboratory the experiment of the other person – to do it under
    condition X to see if she could also get result A, and then change to
    Y and see if A changed. Then she would know that the real difference
    was the thing she thought she had under control.

    She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor.
    And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has
    already been done and you would be wasting time. This was in about
    1947 or so, and it seems to have been the general policy then to not
    try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change the
    conditions and see what happens. Nowadays there's a certain danger of
    the same thing happening, even in the famous field of physics. ...

    Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.

    My rule has to do with paradigm shifts—yes, I do believe in them. I've
    been through a few myself. It is useful if you want to be the first on
    your block to know that the shift has taken place. I formulated the
    rule in 1974. I was visiting the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
    (SLAC) for a weeks to give a couple of seminars on particle physics.
    The subject was QCD. It doesn't matter what this stands for. The point
    is that it was a new theory of sub-nuclear particles and it was
    absolutely clear that it was the right theory. There was no critical
    experiment but the place was littered with smoking guns. Anyway, at
    the end of my first lecture I took a poll of the audience. "What
    probability would you assign to the proposition 'QCD is the right
    theory of hadrons.'?" My socks were knocked off by the answers. They
    ranged from .01 percent to 5 percent. As I said, by this time it was a
    clear no-brainer. The answer should have been close to 100 percent.
    The next day I gave my second seminar and took another poll. "What are
    you working on?" was the question. Answers: QCD, QCD, QCD, QCD,
    QCD,........ Everyone was working on QCD. That's when I learned to ask
    "What are you doing?" instead of "what do you think?"

    I saw exactly the same phenomenon more recently when I was working on
    black holes. This time it was after a string theory seminar, I think
    in Santa Barbara. I asked the audience to vote whether they agreed
    with me and Gerard 't Hooft or if they thought Hawking’s ideas were
    correct. This time I got a 50-50 response. By this time I knew what
    was going on so I wasn't so surprised. Anyway I later asked if anyone
    was working on Hawking's theory of information loss. Not a single hand
    went up. Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.

    It seems that 32 Bostonians have simultaneously dropped dead in a
    ten-block radius for no apparent reason, and General Purcell wants to
    know if it was caused by a covert weapon. Of course, the military has
    been put in charge of the investigation and everything is hush-hush.

    Without examining anything, Keyes takes about five seconds to surmise
    that the victims all died from malfunctioning pacemakers and the
    malfunction was definitely not due to a secret weapon. We're supposed
    to be impressed, but our experience with real scientists and engineers
    indicates that when they're on-the-record, top-notch scientists and

    By the middle of the seventeenth century it had come to be understood
    that the world was enclosed in a sea of air, much as the greater part
    of it was covered by water. A scientist of the period, Francesco Lana,
    contended that a lighter-than-air ship could float upon this sea, and
    he suggested how such a ship might be built. He was unable to put his
    invention to a practical test, but he saw only one reason why it might
    not work:

    "... that God will never suffer this Invention to take effect, because
    of the many consequencies which may disturb the Civil Government of
    men. For who sees not, that no City can be secure against attack,
    since our Ship may at any time be placed directly over it, and
    descending down may discharge Souldiers; the same would happen to
    private Houses, and Ships on the Sea: for our Ship descending out of
    the Air to the sails of Sea-Ships, it may cut their Ropes, yea without
    descending by casting Grapples it may over-set them, kill their men,
    burn their Ships by artificial Fire works and Fire-balls.  And this
    they may do not only to Ships but to great Buildings, Castles, Cities,
    with such security that they which cast these things down from a
    height out of Gun-shot, cannot on the other side be offended by those
    below."

    Lana's reservation was groundless. He had predicted modern air warfare
    in surprisingly accurate detail—with its paratroopers and its strafing
    and bombing. Contrary to his expectation, God has suffered his
    invention to take effect. And so has Man.

    For the Greek philosophers, Greek was the language of reason.
    Aristotle's list of categories is squarely based on the categories of
    Greek grammar. This did not explicitly entail a claim that the Greek
    language was primary: it was simply a case of the identification of
    thought with its natural vehicle. Logos was thought, and Logos was
    speech. About the speech of barbarians little was known; hence, little
    was known about what it would be like to think in the language of
    barbarians. Although the Greeks were willing to admit that the
    Egyptians, for example, possessed a rich and venerable store of
    wisdom, they only knew this because someone had explained it to them
    in Greek.

    Once there was a miser, who to save money would eat nothing but
    oatmeal. And what's more, he would make a great big batch of it at the
    start of every week, and put it in a drawer, and when he wanted a meal
    he would slice off a piece and eat it cold; thus he saved on firewood.
    Now, by the end of the week, the oatmeal would be somewhat moldy and
    not very appetising; and so to make himself eat it, the miser would
    take out a bottle of good whiskey, and pour himself a glass, and say
    "All right, Olai, eat your oatmeal and when you're done, you can have
    a dram." Then he would eat his moldy oatmeal, and when he was done
    he'd laugh and pour the whiskey back in the bottle, and say "Hah! And

    thus he had a great savings in whiskey as well.

    My experience as a marriage counselor taught me that for a discussion
    of a disagreement to be productive, the parties have to have a shared
    understanding of what is being debated. If a husband thinks a marital
    debate is about leaving the toliet seat up or not, and the wife thinks
    it is about why her husband never listens to, appreciates or loves her
    the way he should, expect fireworks and frustration. If you are in an
    argument that you think is about government debt and it’s going
    nowhere, it may be because the person you are debating isn’t really
    arguing about the current level of government debt. Rather, they are
    arguing about the size of government.

    If you get into a debate that is ostensibly about the level of
    government debt, try the following tactic (or try it on yourself in
    your own mind): If your opponent says that government debt is too high
    and we therefore need to cut public spending, ask whether s/he has
    EVER favored under ANY economic conditions a nice, fat increase in
    public spending. If you are debating someone who says that government
    debt is no big deal and that we should be increasing public spending,
    ask if s/he has EVER favored under ANY economics conditions a big, fat
    cut in public spending. You are going to get a no answer most of the
    time; maybe almost all the time.

    Is that wrong? No, it’s just frustrating when you are arguing about
    one thing and the other person is arguing about something else (or,
    when BOTH of you are actually arguing about something other than what
    on the face of it you think you are arguing about). The solution?:
    Drop the charade and get down to business. How big government should
    be is an essential political argument for the members of a society to
    have, so why not just have it up front?

    from me. I was flattered to be asked, and did my best to oblige, but
    the drift of his questions about various philosophical topics was
    strangely perplexing to me. For quite a while we were getting nowhere,
    until finally he managed to make clear to me what he had come for. He
    wanted "an epistemology," he said. An epistemology. Every
    self-respecting literary theorist had to sport an epistemology that
    season, it seems, and without one he felt naked, so he had come to me
    for an epistemology to wear – it was the very next fashion, he was
    sure, and he wanted the dernier cri in epistemologies. It didn't
    matter to him that it be sound, or defensible, or (as one might as

    To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to be

    you can't tell what the attitude of the aircraft is. You could feel
    like you're flying straight and level while in fact you're descending

    One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex.
    When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you
    can cry and say "I can't do it" and the adults will probably let you
    off. As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying "I'm just
    a kid" that will get you out of most difficult situations. Whereas
    adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake. They still do, of
    course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.

    Sorry? Of course he was sorry. People were always sorry. Sorry they

    doing, sorry they were going to do what they were going to do; but
    they still did whatever it was. The sorrow never stopped them; it just

    The Milky-Way galaxy is mind-bogglingly big.

    Eh," you say, "100,000 light years in diameter, give or take a few."

    Sometimes the most remarkable things seem commonplace. I mean, when
    you think about it, jet travel is pretty freaking remarkable. You get
    in a plane, it defies the gravity of an entire planet by exploiting a
    loophole with air pressure, and it flies across distances that would
    take months or years to cross by any means of travel that has been
    significant for more than a century or three. You hurtle above the
    earth at enough speed to kill you instantly should you bump into
    something, and you can only breathe because someone built you a really
    good tin can that has seams tight enough to hold in a decent amount of
    air. Hundreds of millions of man-hours of work and struggle and
    research, blood, sweat, tears, and lives have gone into the history of
    air travel, and it has totally revolutionized the face of our planet
    and societies.

    But get on any flight in the country, and I absolutely promise you
    that you will find someone who, in the face of all that incredible
    achievement, will be willing to complain about the drinks.

I've just come across a fascinatingly compact observation by I. J. Good:

    Public and private utilities do not always coincide. This leads to
    ethical problems. Example - an invention is submitted to a scientific
    adviser of a firm...

    The probability that the invention will work is p. The value to the
    firm if the invention is adopted and works is V, and the loss if the
    invention is adopted and fails is L. The value to the adviser
    personally if he advises the adoption of the invention and it works is
    v, and the loss if it fails to work is l. The losses to the firm and
    the adviser if he recommends the rejection of the invention are both
    negligible...

    Then the firm's expected gain if the invention is adopted is pV -
    (1-p)L and the adviser's expected gain in the same circumstances is pv
    - (1-p)l. The firm has positive expected gain if p/(1-p) L/V, and the
    adviser has positive expected gain if p/(1-p) l/v.

    If l/v p/(1-p) L/V, the adviser will be faced with an ethical problem,
    i.e. he will be tempted to act against the interests of the firm.

This is a beautifully simple recipe for a conflict of interest:

Considering absolute losses assuming failure and absolute gains
conditioned on success, an adviser is incentivized to give the wrong
advice, precisely when:

    The ratio of agent loss to agent gain,
    exceeds the odds of success versus failure
    which in turn exceeds the ratio of principal loss to principal gain.

You can see this reflected in a lot of cases because the gains to an
advisor often don't scale anywhere near as fast as the gains to society or
a firm. It's the Fearful Committee Formula.

    Within the philosophy of science, the view that new discoveries
    constitute a break with tradition was challenged by Polanyi, who
    argued that discoveries may be made by the sheer power of believing
    more strongly than anyone else in current theories, rather than going
    beyond the paradigm. For example, the theory of Brownian motion which
    Einstein produced in 1905, may be seen as a literal articulation of
    the kinetic theory of gases at the time. As Polanyi said:

        Discoveries made by the surprising configuration of existing
        theories might in fact be likened to the feat of a Columbus whose
        genius lay in taking literally and as a guide to action that the
        earth was round, which his contemporaries held vaguely and as a
        mere matter for speculation.

    One interesting thing about Ms. Dowd’s description of "hardball"
    political tactics is just how dainty and genteel her brass knuckle
    suggestions actually are. A speech, an appeal to reason: there is
    nothing here about lucrative contracts for political supporters,
    promises of sinecure jobs for politicians who lose their seats, a
    "blank check" for administrative backing on some obscure tax loophole
    that a particular politician could award to a favored client; there’s
    not even a delicate hint about grand jury investigations that can be
    stopped in their tracks or compromising photographs or wiretaps that
    need never see the light of day. Far be it from Ms Dowd to speak of or
    even hint at the kind of strategy that actual politicians think about
    when words like ‘hardball’ come to mind. Ms Dowd speaks of brass
    knuckles and then shows us a doily; at some level it speaks well of

    The word gentleman originally meant something recognisable: one who
    had a coat of arms and some landed property. When you called someone
    'a gentleman' you were not paying him a compliment, but merely stating
    a fact. If you said he was not 'a gentleman' you were not insulting
    him, but giving information. There was no contradiction in saying that
    John was a liar and a gentleman; any more than there now is in saying
    that James is a fool and an M.A. But then there came people who said-
    so rightly, charitably, spiritually, sensitively, so anything but
    usefully- 'Ah, but surely the important thing about a gentleman is not
    the coat of arms and the land, but the behaviour? Surely he is the
    true gentleman who behaves as a gentleman should? Surely in that sense
    Edward is far more truly a gentleman than John?' They meant well. To
    be honourable and courteous and brave is of course a far better thing
    than to have a coat of arms. But it is not the same thing. Worse
    still, it is not a thing everyone will agree about. To call a man 'a
    gentleman' in this new, refined sense, becomes, in fact, not a way of
    giving information about him, but a way of praising him: to deny that
    he is 'a gentleman' becomes simply a way of insulting him. When a word
    ceases to be a term of description and becomes merely a term of
    praise, it no longer tells you facts about the object; it only tells
    you about the speaker's attitude to that object. (A 'nice' meal only
    means a meal the speaker likes.) A gentleman, once it has been
    spiritualised and refined out of its old coarse, objective sense,
    means hardly more than a man whom the speaker likes. As a result,
    gentleman is now a useless word. We had lots of terms of approval
    already, so it was not needed for that use; on the other hand if
    anyone (say, in a historical work) wants to use it in its old sense,
    he cannot do so without explanations. It has been spoiled for that
    purpose.

    the mass of an object never seems to change: a spinning top has the
    same weight as a still one. So a "law" was invented: mass is constant,
    independent of speed. That "law" is now found to be incorrect. Mass is
    found to increase with velocity, but appreciable increases require
    velocities near that of light. A true law is: if an object moves with
    a speed of less than one hundred miles a second the mass is constant
    to within one part in a million. In some such approximate form this is
    a correct law. So in practice one might think that the new law makes
    no significant difference. Well, yes and no. For ordinary speeds we
    can certainly forget it and use the simple constant-mass law as a good
    approximation. But for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher the
    speed, the more wrong we are.

    Finally, and most interesting, philosophically we are completely wrong
    with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be
    altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a
    very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the
    laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in
    our ideas.

    Mike nodded. He wasn't really surprised, though. One of the things
    he'd come to learn since the Ring of Fire, all the way down to the
    marrow of his bones, was that if the ancestors of twentieth-century
    human beings didn't do something that seemed logical, it was probably
    because it wasn't actually logical at all, once you understood
    everything involved. So it turned out that such notorious military
    numbskulls as Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Phil Sheridan,
    Stonewall Jackson, William Tecumseh Sherman and all the rest of them
    hadn't actually been idiots after all. It was easy for
    twentieth-century professors to proclaim loftily that Civil War
    generals had insisted on continuing with line formations despite the
    advent of the Minié ball-armed rifled musket because the dimwits
    simply hadn't noticed that the guns were accurate for several hundred
    yards. When—cluck; cluck—they should obviously have adopted the
    skirmishing tactics of twentieth-century infantry.

    But it turned out, when put to a ruthless seventeenth-century Swedish
    general's test in his very rigorous notion of field exercises, that
    those professors of a later era had apparently never tried to stand
    their ground when cavalry came at them. After they fired their shot,
    and needed one-third of a minute—if they were adept at the business,
    and didn't get rattled—to have a second shot ready. In that bloody
    world where real soldiers lived and died, skirmishing tactics without
    breechloading rifles or automatic weapons were just a way to commit
    suicide. If the opponent had large enough forces and was willing to
    lose some men, at least.

    Stepan Arkadyevitch subscribed to a liberal paper, and read it. It was
    not extreme in those views, but advocated those principles the
    majority held. And though he was not really interested in science or
    art or politics, he strongly adhered to such views on all those
    subjects as the majority, including his paper, advocated, and he
    changed them only when the majority changed them; or more correctly,
    he did not change them, but they themselves imperceptibly changed in
    him.

    Stepan Arkadyevitch never chose principles or opinions, but these
    principles and opinions came to him, just as he never chose the shape
    of a hat or coat, but took those that others wore. And, living as he
    did in fashionable society, through the necessity of some mental
    activity, developing generally in a man's best years, it was as
    indispensable for him to have views as to have a hat. If there was any
    reason why he preferred liberal views rather than the conservative
    direction which many of his circle followed, it was not because he
    found a liberal tendency more rational, but because he found it better
    suited to his mode of life.

    The liberal party declared that everything in Russia was wretched; and
    the fact was that Stepan Arkadyevitch had a good many debts and was
    decidedly short of money. The liberal party said that marriage was a
    defunct institution and that it needed to be remodeled, and in fact
    domestic life afforded Stepan Arakadyevitch very little pleasure, and
    compelled him to lie, and to pretend, which was contrary to his
    nature. The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be understood,
    that religion is only a curb on the barbarous portion of the
    community, and in fact Stepan Arkadyevitch could not bear the shortest
    prayer without pain in his knees, and he could not comprehend the
    necessity of all these high-sounding words about the other world when
    it was so very pleasant to live in this one.

    I replied with something to the effect that a problem was only
    scientific in the way it was approached, but he would have none of
    that, and he began lecturing me. First, he said, science had certain
    rules. For example, it has to assume that the phenomena it is
    observing is natural in origin rather than artificial and possibly
    biased. Now the UFO phenomenon could be controlled by alien beings.
    "If it is," added the Major, "then the study of it doesn’t belong to
    science. It belongs to Intelligence." Meaning counterespionage. And
    that, he pointed out, was his domain. *

    "Now, in the field of counterespionage, the rules are completely
    different." He drew a simple diagram in my notebook. "You are a
    scientist. In science there is no concept of the ‘price’ of
    information. Suppose I gave you 95 per cent of the data concerning a
    phenomenon. You’re happy because you know 95 per cent of the
    phenomenon. Not so in intelligence. If I get 95 per cent of the data,
    I know that this is the ‘cheap’ part of the information. I still need
    the other 5 percent, but I will have to pay a much higher price to get
    it. You see, Hitler had 95 per cent of the information about the
    landing in Normandy. But he had the wrong 95 percent!"

    "Are you saying that the UFO data we us to compile statistics and to
    find patterns with computers are useless?" I asked. "Might we be
    spinning our magnetic tapes endlessly discovering spurious laws?"

    "It all depends on how the team on the other side thinks. If they know
    what they’re doing, there will be so many cutouts between you and them
    that you won’t have the slightest chance of tracing your way to the
    truth. Not by following up sightings and throwing them into a
    computer. They will keep feeding you the information they want you to
    process. What is the only source of data about the UFO phenomenon? It
    is the UFOs themselves!"

    Some things were beginning to make a lot of sense. "If you’re right,
    what can I do? It seems that research on the phenomenon is hopeless,
    then. I might as well dump my computer into a river."

    "Not necessarily, but you should try a different approach. First you
    should work entirely outside of the organized UFO groups; they are
    infiltrated by the same official agencies they are trying to
    influence, and they propagate any rumour anyone wants to have
    circulated. In Intelligence circles, people like that are historical
    necessities. We call them ‘useful idiots’. When you’ve worked long
    enough for Uncle Sam, you know he is involved in a lot of strange
    things. The data these groups get is biased at the source, but they
    play a useful role.

    "Second, you should look for the irrational, the bizarre, the elements
    that do not fit...Have you ever felt that you were getting close to
    something that didn’t seem to fit any rational pattern yet gave you a
    strong impression that it was significant?"'

    IF you can keep your head when all about you

    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,

    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

    But make allowance for their doubting too;

    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,

    Or being hated, don't give way to hating,

    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

    If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;

    If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;

    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

    And treat those two impostors just the same;

    If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken

    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

    If you can make one heap of all your winnings

    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

    And lose, and start again at your beginnings

    And never breathe a word about your loss;

    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

    To serve your turn long after they are gone,

    And so hold on when there is nothing in you

    Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

    Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,

    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

    If all men count with you, but none too much;

    If you can fill the unforgiving minute

    In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower
    Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles. That
    is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year.
    Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic, can see that
    in the Old Oolitic Silurian Period, just a million years ago next
    November, the Lower Mississippi River was upwards of one million three
    hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico
    like a fishing-rod. And by the same token any person can see that
    seven hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will
    be only a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will
    have joined their streets together, and be plodding comfortably along
    under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. There is
    something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns
    of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.

    It is said, for example, that a man ten times regrets having spoken,
    for the once he regrets his silence. And why? Because the fact of
    having spoken is an external fact, which may involve one in
    annoyances, since it is an actuality. But the fact of having kept
    silent! Yet this is the most dangerous thing of all. For by keeping
    silent one is relegated solely to oneself, no actuality comes to a
    man's aid by punishing him, by bringing down upon him the consequences
    of his speech. No, in this respect, to be silent is the easy way. But
    he who knows what the dreadful is, must for this very reason be most
    fearful of every fault, of every sin, which takes an inward direction
    and leaves no outward trace. So it is too that in the eyes of the
    world it is dangerous to venture. And why? Because one may lose. But
    not to venture is shrewd. And yet, by not venturing, it is so
    dreadfully easy to lose that which it would be difficult to lose in
    even the most venturesome venture, and in any case never so easily, so
    completely as if it were nothing...one's self. For if I have ventured
    amiss – very well, then life helps me by its punishment. But if I have
    not ventured at all – who then helps me?

    of a well, tied down with kryptonite and surrounded by a hundred
    thousand tanks (or something along these lines). It was a cliffhanger.
    He then made his salary demands. His employers refused and went round
    every writer in America, but nobody could work out how the original
    writer was planning to have Superman escape. Eventually the radio guys
    had to go back to him and meet his wage demands. The first show of the

    It parses its own circuitry in terms of cosmic-ray metaphors, because

    One of the biggest tasks, according to Gardner, was tracking
    information and beliefs back to their roots. This is always important,
    but especially in a field as rich in hearsay as herbal medicine. One
    little piece of information, or an unsubstantiated report, can grow
    and become magnified, quickly becoming an unquestioned truism. She
    used as an example the truism that the extracts of the herb Ginkgo
    Biloba might cause dangerous bleeding. Everyone says it can. The
    journalists say it. The doctors say it. The herbalists say it. Even I
    say it! It's nearly impossible to read a scientific paper on Ginkgo
    that doesn't mention this alleged danger. But why do we say it - where
    did the information come from? Turns out, there was one case report -
    of a single person - who couldn't clot efficiently after taking
    Ginkgo. Another 178 papers were published that mentioned this danger,
    citing only this one report. Those 178 papers were cited by over 4,100
    other papers. So now we have almost 4-and-a-half thousand references
    in the scientific literature - not to mention the tens of thousands of
    references in the popular press - to the dangers of Ginkgo, all
    traceable back to a single person whose bleeding may or may not have
    been attributable to the herb.

    on. Decisions that lead to actions. We wouldn't do much of anything,

    work and energy invested in them. They feel so important, so full of
    themselves. They will answer to no one. Not even to their initial
    question!

    What's the point if a wrong answer will stop you from returning to the
    right question. Although sometimes people have no questions to return
    to... which is usually why they defend them, with such strong
    conviction.

    ago and continues to hold his political opinions after he has been
    proved to be wrong is a man of principle; while he who from time to

    Foundations matter. Always and forever. Regardless of domain. Even if
    you meticulously plug all abstraction leaks, the lowest-level concepts
    on which a system is built will mercilessly limit the heights to which
    its high-level "payload" can rise. For it is the bedrock abstractions
    of a system which create its overall flavor. They are the ultimate
    constraints on the range of thinkable thoughts for designer and user
    alike. Ideas which flow naturally out of the bedrock abstractions will
    be thought of as trivial, and will be deemed useful and necessary.
    Those which do not will be dismissed as impractical frills — or will
    vanish from the intellectual landscape entirely. Line by line, the
    electronic shanty town grows. Mere difficulties harden into hard
    limits. The merely arduous turns into the impossible, and then finally
    into the unthinkable.

    Somebody could give me this glass of water and tell me that it’s
    water. But there’s a lot of clear liquids out there and I might
    actually have a real case that this might not be water. Now most cases
    when something like a liquid is in a cup it’s water.

    A good way to find out if it’s water is to test if it has two
    hydrogens per oxygen in each molecule in the glass and you can test
    that. If it evaporates like water, if it tastes like water, freezes
    like water… the more tests we apply, the more sure we can be that it’s
    water.

    However, if it were some kind of acid and we started to test and we
    found that the hydrogen count is off, the oxygen count is off, it
    doesn’t taste like water, it doesn’t behave like water, it doesn’t
    freeze like water, it just looks like water. If we start to do these
    tests, the more we will know the true nature of the liquid in this
    glass. That is how we find truth. We can test it any number of ways;
    the more we test it, the more we know the truth of what it is that
    we’re dealing with.

    [O]ne may also focus on a single problem, which can appear in
    different guises in various disciplines, and vary the methods. An
    advantage of viewing the same problem through the lens of different
    models is that we can often begin to identify which features of the
    problem are enduring and which are artifacts of our particular methods
    or background assumptions. Because abstraction is a license for us to
    ignore information, looking at several approaches to modeling a
    problem can give you insight into what is important to keep and what
    is noise to ignore. Moreover, discovering robust features of a
    problem, when it happens, can reshape your intuitions.

    Closeness in the experiment was reasonably literal but may also be
    interpreted in terms of identification with the torturer. If the

    more likely to think the tortured are guilty. If the state is doing
    the torturing then the especially patriotic (close to their country)
    may be more likely to think that the tortured/killed/jailed/abused are
    guilty. That part is fairly obvious but note the second less obvious
    implication–the worse the victim is treated the more the
    religious/patriotic will believe the victim is guilty. ... Research in

    One of the most impressive features of brains – especially human
    brains — is the flexibility to learn almost any kind of task that
    comes its way. Give an apprentice the desire to impress his master and
    a chicken-sexing task, and his brain devotes its massive resources to
    distinguishing males from females. Give an unemployed aviation
    enthusiast a chance to be a national hero, and his brain learns to
    distinguish enemy aircraft from local flyboys. This flexibility of
    learning accounts for a large part of what we consider human
    intelligence. While many animals are properly called intelligent,
    humans distinguish themselves in that they are so flexibly
    intelligent, fashioning their neural circuits to match the task at
    hand. It is for this reason that we can colonize every region on the
    planet, learn the local language we’re born into, and master skills as
    diverse as playing the violin, high-jumping and operating space
    shuttle cockpits.

    We would all like to believe that if we win something it is because of
    our skill, but if we lose it is because of the good luck or cheating
    of our opponent. This is nowhere more apparent than in the game of
    backgammon. A good opponent will play in such a way that the dice
    rolls having highest probability will be "good rolls" for them on
    their next turn, enabling them to take the other player's pieces,
    consolidate their position, etc. However, since there is an element of
    randomness, when these rolls actually come up it is very difficult
    even for me to believe that my opponent's fortune is due to their
    skill rather than their luck. Whenever I am being consistently beaten
    by an opponent I have to fight very hard to make myself believe that
    there is actually something wrong with my play and figure out how to
    correct it.

    This phenomenon is nowhere more apparent than in computer backgammon.
    Computer backgammon is essentially a solved problem. Unlike Chess or
    Go, the best neural network algorithms that run even on modest
    hardware will consistently beat most human players, and perhaps draw
    with the best in the world. In fact, we have learnt rather a lot from
    these algorithms. Many rules of thumb that were believed for years by
    most decent players have been overturned by computer simulations.
    Computers tend to play backgammon markedly more aggressively than is
    natural for a human, but we can show that they are nevertheless doing
    the right thing. If you are not an extremely high level player,
    playing against a good computer algorithm feels weird if you are used
    to playing against humans.

    One of the most annoying results of this is that it is impossible to
    obtain a reliable user generated rating of a backgammon program. For
    example, GNU Backgammon is one of the two or three best algorithms in
    the world and an under-appreciated gem of the GNU project as a whole.
    A full 50% of the user reviews on the Ubuntu software centre accuse
    the program of cheating by fixing the dice rolls and give it a 1 or 2
    star review. It is hilarious how many of these reviews include
    comments like they "know how to play" or have been "playing for a long
    time" as if this were evidence to support their claim. The rest of the
    reviews are by people who know better and they all give it 4 or 5
    stars (4 is reasonable due to a few user interface quirks, but the
    algorithm itself is worth a 5). As a result, the averaged rating is
    only 3 stars, even though this is widely acknowledged as one of the
    three best backgammon programs in the world. It doesn't cheat because
    it doesn't have to, and it actually gives you mechanisms for checking
    that it is not cheating, e.g. entering dice rolls manually and a tutor
    mode that will correct your bad plays.

    This phenomenon is repeated absolutely everywhere that user reviews of
    backgammon programs are available. On the Google Play store, I have
    seen this even on a program with an absolutely crappy algorithm that I
    can consistently beat on expert level as well as on decent ones that
    are backed by GNUbg. As a result, it is absolutely impossible to find
    out which are the good backgammon programs if you don't already know,
    since they all get a low average rating.

Rationality wakes up last:

    In those first seconds, I'm always thinking some version of this: "Oh,
    no!!! This time is different. Now my arm is dead and it's never
    getting better. I'm a one-armed guy now. I'll have to start drawing
    left-handed. I wonder if anyone will notice my dead arm. Should I keep
    it in a sling so people know it doesn't work or should I ask my doctor
    to lop it off? If only I had rolled over even once during the night.
    But nooo, I have to sleep on my arm until it dies. That is so like me.
    What happens if I sleep on the other one tomorrow night? Can I learn
    to use a fork with my feet?"

    Then at about the fifth second, some feeling returns to my arm and I
    experience hope. I also realize that if people could lose their arms
    after sleeping on them there wouldn't be many people left on earth
    with two good arms. Apparently the rational part of my mind wakes up

    I guess my point here is that part of the reason I stayed in Mormonism
    so long was that the people arguing against Mormonism were using such
    ridiculously bad arguments. I tried to find the most rigorous
    reasoning and the strongest research that opposed LDS theology, but
    the best they could come up with was stuff like horses in the Book of
    Mormon. It's so easy for a Latter-Day Saint to simply write the horse
    references off as either a slight mistranslation or a gap in current
    scientific knowledge that that kind of "evidence" wasn't worth the
    time of day to me. And for every horse problem there was something
    like Hugh Nibley's "Two Shots in the Dark" or Eugene England's work on
    Lehi's alleged travels across Saudi Arabia, apologetic works that made
    Mormon historical and theological claims look vaguely plausible. There
    were bright, thoughtful people on both sides of the Mormon apologetics

    the checks to support you. The people that are writing the donation
    checks are what keep organizations in business oftentimes. The people
    that are receiving the services, then, are oftentimes not paying for
    the services, and therefore their voice is not heard. And so within
    the nonprofit space, we’ve created a system where he/she who tells the
    best story is the one that’s rewarded. There’s an incentive to push
    down the stories that are not of positive impact. There’s the
    incentive to pretend that there are no negative things that happen,
    there’s the incentive to make sure that our failures are never made
    public, and there’s the disconnected between who’s paying for the
    service and who’s receiving the services. When you disconnect those
    two aspects, you do not have accountability that acts in the best

From the remarkable opening chapter of Consciousness Explained:

    One should be leery of these possibilities in principle. It is also
    possible in principle to build a stainless-steel ladder to the moon,
    and to write out, in alphabetical order, all intelligible English
    conversations consisting of less than a thousand words. But neither of
    these are remotely possible in fact and sometimes an impossibility in
    fact is theoretically more interesting than a possibility in

    The hidden thought embedded in most discussions of conspiracy theories
    is this: The world is being controlled by evil people; so, if we can
    get rid of them, the world can revert to control by good people, and
    things will be great again. This thought is false. The world is not
    controlled by any group of people – evil or good – and it will not be.
    The world is a large, chaotic mess. Those groups which do exert some
    control are merely larger pieces in the global mix.

    At college in 1980, my Government Studies prof also served as
    Secretary of the Socialist Workers Party of Minnesota (the real one,
    not the DFL). We clashed over Robert Mugabe, just coming to power in
    Zimbabwe, he asserting it spelled salvation and I, that it spelled
    ruin.

    I e-mailed him a year or two ago, asking if I could get a retroactive
    grade increase since my predictions had proven more accurate than his.
    His explanation was that he truly believed Mugabe was an agrarian
    reformer whose program of taking land from Whites to give to Blacks
    would benefit the country; but things just hadn't worked out as hoped.

    I didn't bother to send him the famous Heinlein quote about Bad Luck.

    But consider: Newton has thought things that no man before has ever
    thought. A great accomplishment to be sure. Perhaps the greatest
    achievement any human mind has ever made. Very well - what does that
    say of Newton, and of us? Why, that his mind is framed in such a way
    that it can out-think anyone else's. So all hail Isaac Newton! Let us
    give him his due, and glorify and worship whatever generative force
    can frame such a mind.

    Now consider Hooke. Hooke has perceived things that no man before us
    has ever perceived. What does that say of Hooke, and of us? That Hooke
    was framed in some special way? No, for just look at you, Robert - by
    your leave, you are stooped, asthmatic, fitful, beset by aches and
    ills, your eyes and ears are no better than those of men who've not
    perceived a thousandth part of what you have.

    Newton makes his discoveries in geometrical realms, where our minds
    cannot go, he strolls in a walled garden filled with wonders, to which
    he has the only key. But you Hooke, are cheek-by-jowl with all of
    humanity in the streets of London. Anyone can look at the things you
    have looked at. But in those things you see what no one else has. You
    are the millionth human to look at a spark, a flea, a raindrop, the
    moon, and the first to see it. For anyone to say that this is less
    remarkable than what Newton has done, is to understand things in but a

    the designers of a theoretical technology in any but the most
    predictable of areas should identify its assumptions and claims that
    have not already been tested in a laboratory. They should design not
    only the technology but also a map of the uncertainties and edge cases
    in the design and a series of such experiments and tests that would
    progressively reduce these uncertainties. A proposal that lacks this
    admission of uncertainties coupled with designs of experiments that
    will reduce such uncertainties should not be deemed credible for the
    purposes of any important decision. We might call this requirement a

    The reason that testability is not enough is that prediction is not,
    and cannot be, the purpose of science. Consider an audience watching a
    conjuring trick. The problem facing them has much the same logic as a
    scientific problem. Although in nature there is no conjurer trying to
    deceive us intentionally, we can be mystified in both cases for
    essentially the same reason: appearances are not self-explanatory. If
    the explanation of a conjuring trick were evident in its appearance,
    there would be no trick. If the explanations of physical phenomena
    were evident in their appearance, empiricism would be true and there
    would be no need for science as we know it. The problem is not to
    predict the trick's appearance. I may, for instance predict that if a
    conjurer seems to place various balls under various cups, those cups
    will later appear to be empty; and I may predict that if the conjurer
    appears to saw someone in half, that person will later appear on stage
    unharmed. Those are testable predictions. I may experience many
    conjuring shows and see my predictions vindicated every time. But that
    does not even address, let alone solve, the problem of how the trick
    works. Solving it requires an explanation: a statement of the reality
    which accounts for the trick's appearance.

    I notice with some amusement, both in America and English literature,

    It is startling to realize how much unbelief is necessary to make
    belief possible. What we know as blind faith is sutained by
    innnumerable unbeliefs: the fanatical Japanese in Brazil refused to
    believe for years the evidence of Japan's defeat; the fanatical
    Communist refuses to believe any unfavorable reports or evidence about
    Russia, nor will he be disillusioned by seeing with his own eyes the
    cruel misery inside the Soviet promised land.

    It is the true believer's ability to "shut his eyes and stop his ears"
    to facts that do not deserve to be either seen or heard which is the
    source of his unequaled fortitude and constancy. He can not be
    frightened by danger, nor disheartened by obstacles nor baffled by
    contradictions because he denies their existence. Strength of faith,
    as Bergson pointed out, manifests itself not in moving mountains, but

    The opposite is the sleuth’s approach, the detective’s approach to

    [O]ur moral judgments are less reliable than many would hope, and this
    has specific implications for methodology in normative ethics. Three
    sources of evidence indicate that our intuitive ethical judgments are
    less reliable than we might have hoped: a historical record of
    accepting morally absurd social practices; a scientific record showing
    that our intuitive judgments are systematically governed by a host of
    heuristics, biases, and irrelevant factors; and a philosophical record
    showing deep, probably unresolvable, inconsistencies in common moral
    convictions. I argue that this has the following implications for
    moral theorizing: we should trust intuitions less; we should be
    especially suspicious of intuitive judgments that fit a bias pattern,
    even when we are intuitively confident that these judgments are not a
    simple product of the bias; we should be especially suspicious of
    intuitions that are part of inconsistent sets of deeply held
    convictions; and we should evaluate views holistically, thinking of
    entire classes of judgments that they get right or wrong in broad
    contexts, rather than dismissing positions on the basis of a small
    number of intuitive counterexamples.

    My 5 year old came to the dinner table, and calmly announced, "There is
    no Santa." I was puzzled because just couple of days ago he had taken
    his Christmas gift from Santa (though now that I think about it, he was
    not totally thrilled). So I asked why he thought so. He said, "Well, for
    Christmas I only got the gifts I told you about; I had gone to bed and
    told Santa himself what I wanted without telling you to see if he is
    real, and none of those came through - and I was a good boy all year!"

    To be sure, I asked him, "But you saw Santa at the mall?" He laughed as

The mathematician and Fields medalist Vladimir Voevodsky on using automated proof assistants in mathematics:

    [Following the discovery of some errors in his earlier work:] I think it
    was at this moment that I largely stopped doing what is called
    “curiosity driven research” and started to think seriously about the
    future.

    [...]

    A technical argument by a trusted author, which is hard to check and
    looks similar to arguments known to be correct, is hardly ever checked
    in detail.

    [...]

    It soon became clear that the only real long-term solution to the
    problems that I encountered is to start using computers in the
    verification of mathematical reasoning.

    [...]

    Among mathematicians computer proof verification was almost a forbidden
    subject. A conversation started about the need for computer proof
    assistants would invariably drift to the Goedel Incompleteness Theorem
    (which has nothing to do with the actual problem) or to one or two cases
    of verification of already existing proofs, which were used only to
    demonstrate how impractical the whole idea was.

    [...]

    I now do my mathematics with a proof assistant and do not have to worry
    all the time about mistakes in my arguments or about how to convince
    others that my arguments are correct.

    As burglars, they used some unusual techniques...During their casing,
    they had noticed that the interior door that opened to the draft board
    office was always locked. There was no padlock to replace...The break-in
    technique they settled on at that office must be unique in the annals of
    burglary. Several hours before the burglary was to take place, one of
    them wrote a note and tacked it to the door they wanted to enter:
    "Please don't lock this door tonight." Sure enough, when the burglars
    arrived that night, someone had obediently left the door unlocked. The
    burglars entered the office with ease, stole the Selective Service
    records, and left. They were so pleased with themselves that one of them
    proposed leaving a thank-you note on the door. More cautious minds
    prevailed. Miss Manners be damned, they did not leave a note.

    This morning my daughter told me that she did well on a spelling test,
    but she got the easiest words wrong. Of course that’s not exactly true.
    The words that are hardest for her to spell are the ones she in fact did
    not spell correctly. She probably meant that she missed the words she
    felt should have been easy. Maybe they were short words. Children can be
    intimidated by long words, even though long words tend to be more
    regular and thus easier to spell.

    Our perceptions of what is easy are often upside-down. We feel that some
    things should be easy even though our experience tells us otherwise.

    Sometimes the trickiest parts of a subject come first, but we think that
    because they come first they should be easy. For example, force-body
    diagrams come at the beginning of an introductory physics class, but
    they can be hard to get right. Newton didn’t always get them right. More
    advanced physics, say celestial mechanics, is in some ways easier, or at
    least less error-prone.

    “Elementary” and “easy” are not the same. Sometimes they’re opposites.

    As the world becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can

    The use with children of experimental [educational] methods, that is,

    experimental in that we know very little about their educational
    efficacy in comparison with alternative methods. There is widespread
    cynicism among students and even among practiced teachers about the
    effectiveness of lecturing or repetitive drill (which we would
    distinguish from carefully designed practice), yet these methods are in
    widespread use. Equally troublesome, new "theories" of education are
    introduced into schools every day (without labeling them as experiments)
    on the basis of their philosophical or common-sense plausibility but
    without genuine empirical support. We should make a larger place for
    responsible experimentation that draws on the available knowledge--it
    deserves at least as large a place as we now provide for faddish,
    unsystematic and unassessed informal "experiments" or educational
    "reforms."

    A shipowner was about to send to sea an emigrant-ship. He know that she
    was old, and not over-well built at the first; that she had seen many
    seas and climes, and often had needed repairs. Doubts had been suggested
    to him that possibly she was not seaworthy. These doubts preyed upon his
    mind and made him unhappy; he thought that perhaps he ought to have her
    thoroughly overhauled and refitted, even though this should put him to
    great expense. Before the ship sailed, however, he succeeded in
    overcoming these melancholy reflections. He said to himself that she had
    gone safely though so many voyages and weathered so many storms, that it
    was idle to suppose she would not come safely home from this trip also.
    He would put his trust in Providence, which could hardly fail to protect
    all these unhappy families that were leaving their fatherland to seek
    for better times elsewhere. He would dismiss from his mind all
    ungenerous suspicions about the honesty of builders and contractors. In
    such a way he acquired a sincere and comfortable conviction that his
    vessel was thoroughly safe and seaworthy; he watched her depature with a
    light heart, and benevolent wishes for the success of the exiles in
    their strange new home that was to be; and he got his insurance-money
    when she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales.

    What shall we say of him? Surely this, that he was verily guilty of the
    death of those men. It is admitted that he did sincerely believe in the
    soundness of his ship, but the sincerity of his conviction can in nowise
    help him, because he had no right to believe on such evidence as was
    before him. He had acquired his belief not by honestly earning it in
    patient investigation, but by stifling his doubts.

    Alex Jordan, a grad student at Stanford, came up with the idea of asking

    judgments about four controversial issues, such as marriage between
    first cousins, or a film studio’s decision to release a documentary with
    a director who had tricked some people into being interviewed. Alex
    stood right next to a trash can he had emptied. Before he recruited each

    fart spray twice into the bag, which “perfumed” the whole intersection

    Now, one basic principle in all of science is GIGO: garbage in, garbage
    out. This principle is particularly important in statistical
    meta-analysis: because if you have a bunch of methodologically poor
    studies, each with small sample size, and then subject them to
    meta-analysis, what can happen is that the systematic biases in each
    study - if they mostly point in the same direction - can reach
    statistical significance when the studies are pooled. And this
    possibility is particularly relevant here, because meta-analyses of
    homeopathy invariably find an inverse correlation between the
    methodological quality of the study and the observed effectiveness of
    homeopathy: that is, the sloppiest studies find the strongest evidence
    in favor of homeopathy. When one restricts attention only to
    methodologically sound studies - those that include adequate
    randomization and double-blinding, predefined outcome measures, and
    clear accounting for drop-outs - the meta-analyses find no statistically
    significant effect (whether positive or negative) of homeopathy compared

    Another possibility is that our intuitive sense of justice is a set of
    heuristics: moral machinery that’s very useful but far from infallible.
    We have a taste for punishment. This taste, like all tastes, is subtle
    and complicated, shaped by a complex mix of genetic, cultural, and
    idiosyncratic factors. But our taste for punishment is still a taste,
    implemented by automatic settings and thus limited by its inflexibility.
    All tastes can be fooled. We fool our taste buds with artificial
    sweeteners. We fool our sexual appetites with birth control and
    pornography, both of which supply sexual gratification while doing
    nothing to spread our genes. Sometimes, however, our tastes make fools
    of us. Our tastes for fat and sugar make us obese in a world of
    abundance. Drugs of abuse hijack our reward circuits and destroy
    people’s lives. To know whether we’re fooling our tastes or whether our
    tastes are fooling us, we have to step outside the limited perspective
    of our tastes: To what extent is this thing-diet soda, porn, Nutella,
    heroin-really serving our bests interests? We should ask the same
    question about our taste for punishment.

    will not barter secrets."

    strengths are that I understand the way crowds think and that I am good
    at thinking up unexpected ways to solve simple problems. My army's
    biggest weakness is that my soldiers are inexperienced, and that
    unexpected developments have an inordinate effect on their morale. Also,
    my infantry will never be able to stand against a sustained lion charge,
    so I have to keep finding ways to nullify that disadvantage, and frankly
    I won't be able to forever."

    "I don't understand. What are you doing, Mare? Why are you--"

    "--my personal biggest weaknesses," she continued, her smile now
    malicious, "are my struggles with morality, identity, and my desire to
    be loved. There's also my relationship with the stallion Macintosh
    Apple, who is usually called Big Macintosh, with whom I spend upwards of
    ten hours a day, and on whom I am completely emotionally dependent. If
    he were to be killed, I'd probably fall apart emotionally. I also have a
    daughter named Dinky - not by him, mind you - who is in the Southmarch,
    and who I am very, very guilty about abandoning. If anything were to
    happen to her I might kill myself. Do you understand yet, Broadwings?"

    "Mare, this is insanity. I cannot--"

    "--All right then, we'll continue. I also have in this camp Sweetie
    Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo, three little fillies, though they're
    growing quite quickly now. Sweetie Belle is the writer of many
    propaganda songs, Apple Bloom is Big Mac's sister, who he protects like
    a daughter, and I believe Scootaloo has no special importance but the
    other two would defend her to the death. They would be quite easy to
    kill as well. Do you understand yet?"

    "Mare! Are you mad?! Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to tell me
    these things? Aren't you afraid I would tell--"

    "--Good," she nodded. "You're beginning to understand. Let's see. My
    logistics framework right now is nonexistent. I'm entirely reliant on
    local villages bringing me food and materiel, and on capturing food and
    materiel meant for your armies. My army is nowhere near as mobile as it
    appears, since it can only operate in areas where I have established
    relationships with each particular village. A bit of simple recon work
    would let you figure out where I can and cannot go. Do you understand
    yet?"

    Broadwings' eyes opened and his pupils shrank with dawning recognition.
    "...If I came back to my army, I would use this to defeat you. If I told
    any other gryphon, they would use it to defeat you. You...you have..."

    "Yes. I have sealed your fate; you will not see your home. I can't let
    you leave now. I absolutely can't. I can now either kill you or keep you
    prisoner until this war is over-and I don't keep useless prisoners. It's

    It will be said that, while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not
    know how to fill their days if they had only four hours of work out of
    the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world, it is a
    condemnation of our civilization; it would not have been true at any
    earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness and
    play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency.
    The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of
    something else, and never for its own sake. Serious-minded persons, for
    example, are continually condemning the habit of going to the cinema,
    and telling us that it leads the young into crime. But all the work that
    goes to producing a cinema is respectable, because it is work, and
    because it brings a money profit. The notion that the desirable
    activities are those that bring a profit has made everything
    topsy-turvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who
    provides you with bread are praiseworthy, because they are making money;
    but when you enjoy the food they have provided, you are merely
    frivolous, unless you eat only to get strength for your work. Broadly
    speaking, it is held that getting money is good and spending money is
    bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one transaction, this is absurd;
    one might as well maintain that keys are good, but keyholes are bad.
    Whatever merit there may be in the production of goods must be entirely
    derivative from the advantage to be obtained by consuming them. The
    individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose of
    his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce
    between the individual and the social purpose of production that makes
    it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which
    profit-making is the incentive to industry. We think too much of
    production, and too little of consumption. One result is that we attach
    too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do
    not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer.

    One afternoon a student said "Roshi, I don't really understand what's

    water-bucket, and Todd got enlightened when you popped him one with your
    staff, and people work on koans and get enlightened, but I've been doing
    this for two years now, and the koans don't make any sense, and I don't
    feel enlightened at all! Can you just tell me what's going on?"

    "Well you see," Roshi replied, "for most people, and especially for most
    educated people like you and I, what we perceive and experience is
    heavily mediated, through language and concepts that are deeply
    ingrained in our ways of thinking and feeling. Our objective here is to
    induce in ourselves and in each other a psychological state that
    involves the unmediated experience of the world, because we believe that
    that state has certain desirable properties. It's impossible in general
    to reach that state through any particular form or method, since forms
    and methods are themselves examples of the mediators that we are trying
    to avoid. So we employ a variety of ad hoc means, some linguistic like
    koans and some non-linguistic like zazen, in hopes that for any given
    student one or more of our methods will, in whatever way, engender the
    condition of non-mediated experience that is our goal. And since even
    thinking in terms of mediators and goals tends to reinforce our
    undesirable dependency on concepts, we actively discourage exactly this
    kind of analytical discourse."

    Surgeons finally did upgrade their antiseptic standards at the end of
    the nineteenth century. But, as is often the case with new ideas, the
    effort required deeper changes than anyone had anticipated. In their
    blood-slick, viscera-encrusted black coats, surgeons had seen themselves
    as warriors doing hemorrhagic battle with little more than their bare
    hands. A few pioneering Germans, however, seized on the idea of the
    surgeon as scientist. They traded in their black coats for pristine
    laboratory whites, refashioned their operating rooms to achieve the
    exacting sterility of a bacteriological lab, and embraced anatomic
    precision over speed.

    The key message to teach surgeons, it turned out, was not how to stop
    germs but how to think like a laboratory scientist. Young physicians
    from America and elsewhere who went to Germany to study with its
    surgical luminaries became fervent converts to their thinking and their
    standards. They returned as apostles not only for the use of antiseptic
    practice (to kill germs) but also for the much more exacting demands of
    aseptic practice (to prevent germs), such as wearing sterile gloves,
    gowns, hats, and masks. Proselytizing through their own students and
    colleagues, they finally spread the ideas worldwide.

    But losing can be upsetting, and can cause emotions to take the place of
    logical thinking. Below are some common “losing attitudes.” If you find
    yourself saying these things, consider it a red flag.

    “At least I have my Code of Honor,” a.k.a. “You are cheap!”

    This is by far the most common call of the scrub, and I’ve already
    described it in detail. The loser usually takes the imagined moral high
    ground by sticking to his Code of Honor, a made-up set of personal rules
    that tells him which moves he can and cannot do. Of course, the rules of
    the game itself dictate which moves a player can and cannot make, so the
    Code of Honor is superfluous and counterproductive toward winning. This
    can also take the form of the loser complaining that you have broken his
    Code of Honor. He will almost always assume the entire world agrees on
    his Code and that only the most vile social outcasts would ever break
    his rules. It can be difficult to even reason with the kind of religious
    fervor some players have toward their Code. This type of player is
    trying desperately to remain a “winner” any way possible. If you catch
    him amidst a sea of losses, you’ll notice that his Code will undergo
    strange contortions so that he may still define himself, somehow, as a
    “winner.”

    Specifically, [these recent books that deal with parallel universes]
    argue that if some scientific theory X has enough experimental support
    for us to take it seriously, then we must take seriously also all its
    predictions Y, even if these predictions are themselves untestable
    (involving parallel universes, for example).

    As a warm-up example, let's consider Einstein's theory of General
    Relativity. It's widely considered a scientific theory worthy of taking
    seriously, because it has made countless correct predictions -- from the
    gravitational bending of light to the time dilation measured by our GPS
    phones. This means that we must also take seriously its prediction for
    what happens inside black holes, even though this is something we can
    never observe and report on in Scientific American. If someone doesn't
    like these black hole predictions, they can't simply opt out of them and
    dismiss them as unscientific: instead, they need to come up with a
    different mathematical theory that matches every single successful
    prediction that general relativity has made -- yet doesn't give the
    disagreeable black hole predictions.

    How much of a disaster is this? Well, it’s never a disaster to learn

    may be disappointing, but it’s much better to know the truth than to
    waste time chasing a fantasy. Also, there can be far more to it than
    that. The effect of discovering that your hopes are dashed is often that
    you readjust your hopes. If you had a subgoal that you now realize is
    unachievable, but you still believe that the main goal might be
    achievable, then your options have been narrowed down in a potentially

    Almost no innovative programs work, in the sense of reliably
    demonstrating benefits in excess of costs in replicated RCTs [randomized

    fields like education, criminology and social welfare demonstrate
    statistically significant benefits in RCTs. When presented with an
    intelligent-sounding program endorsed by experts in the topic, our
    rational Bayesian prior ought to be “It is very likely that this program
    would fail to demonstrate improvement versus current practice if I
    tested it.”

    In other words, discovering program improvements that really work is

    When I was 16, I wanted to follow in my grandfathers footsteps. I wanted
    to be a tradesman. I wanted to build things, and fix things, and make
    things with my own two hands. This was my passion, and I followed it for
    years. I took all the shop classes at school, and did all I could to
    absorb the knowledge and skill that came so easily to my granddad.
    Unfortunately, the handy gene skipped over me, and I became frustrated.
    But I remained determined to do whatever it took to become a tradesman.

    One day, I brought home a sconce from woodshop that looked like a
    paramecium, and after a heavy sigh, my grandfather told me the truth. He
    explained that my life would be a lot more satisfying and productive if
    I got myself a different kind of toolbox. This was almost certainly the
    best advice I’ve ever received, but at the time, it was crushing. It
    felt contradictory to everything I knew about persistence, and the
    importance of “staying the course.” It felt like quitting. But here’s
    the “dirty truth,” Stephen. “Staying the course” only makes sense if
    you’re headed in a sensible direction. Because passion and persistence -
    while most often associated with success - are also essential
    ingredients of futility.

    That’s why I would never advise anyone to “follow their passion” until I
    understand who they are, what they want, and why they want it. Even
    then, I’d be cautious. Passion is too important to be without, but too
    fickle to be guided by. Which is why I’m more inclined to say, “Don’t
    Follow Your Passion, But Always Bring it With You.”

    I propose we simply postpone the worrisome question of what really has a
    mind, about what the proper domain of the intentional stance is.
    Whatever the right answer to that question is-if it has a right
    answer-this will not jeopardize the plain fact that the intentional
    stance works remarkably well as a prediction method in these other
    areas, almost as well as it works in our daily lives as folk
    psychologists dealing with other people. This move of mine annoys and
    frustrates some philosophers, who want to blow the whistle and insist on
    properly settling the issue of what a mind, a belief, a desire is before
    taking another step. Define your terms, sir! No, I won’t. That would be
    premature. I want to explore first the power and the extent of
    application of this good trick, the intentional stance. Once we see what
    it is good for, and why, we can come back and ask ourselves if we still
    feel the need for formal, watertight definitions. My move is an instance
    of nibbling on a tough problem instead of trying to eat (and digest) the
    whole thing from the outset. “Many of the thinking tools I will be
    demonstrating are good at nibbling, at roughly locating a few “fixed”
    points that will help us see the general shape of the problem. In Elbow
    Room (1984a), o compared my method to the sculptor’s method of roughing
    out the form in a block of marble, approaching the final surfaces
    cautiously, modestly, working by successive approximation. Many
    philosophers apparently cannot work that way and have to secure (or so
    they think) the utterly fixed boundaries of their problems and possible
    solutions before they can venture any hypotheses.

    are consistent." And if it feels worthwhile, you can make a genuine
    effort to understand that entire worldview. You don't have to adopt it.

    Nature is constantly given human qualities. Wordsworth wrote that

    benevolent.

    Nature is purposeless. Nature simply is. We may find nature beautiful or
    terrible, but those feelings are human constructions. Such utter and
    complete mindlessness is hard for us to accept. We feel such a strong
    connection to nature. But the relationship between nature and us is
    one-sided. There is no reciprocity. There is no mind on the other side

    But if that were the case, then moral philosophers - who reason about
    ethical principles all day long - should be more virtuous than other
    people. Are they? The philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel tried to find out.
    He used surveys and more surreptitious methods to measure how often
    moral philosophers give to charity, vote, call their mothers, donate
    blood, donate organs, clean up after themselves at philosophy
    conferences, and respond to emails purportedly from students. And in
    none of these ways are moral philosophers better than other philosophers
    or professors in other fields.

    Schwitzgebel even scrounged up the missing-book lists from dozens of
    libraries and found that academic books on ethics, which are presumably
    mostly borrowed by ethicists, are more likely to be stolen or just never
    returned than books in other areas of philosophy. In other words,
    expertise in moral reasoning does not seem to improve moral behavior,
    and it might even make it worse (perhaps by making the rider more
    skilled at post hoc justification). Schwitzgebel still has yet to find a
    single measure on which moral philosophers behave better than other
    philosophers.

    Jonathon Haidt, discussing the idea that ethical reasoning causes good
    behaviour, in his book 'The Righteous Mind'.

I found the book-stealing thing quite funny, although I imagine that some of
the results described could be explained by popularity; if more people get
into / like ethics, then there are more people who might steal library
books, more antisocial people who don't respond to emails, etc. This hasn't
been demonstrated to my knowledge though, and I'm otherwise inclined to
believe that people who spend their days thinking about ethics in the
abstract, are simply better at coming up with rationales for their
instinctive feelings. Joshua Greene says rights are an example of this,
where we need a dictum against whatever our emotions are telling us is
despicable, even though we can't find any utilitarian justification for it.

    A BS detection Heuristic.

    You can tell if a discipline is BS if the degree depends severely on the
    prestige of the school granting it. I remember when I applied to MBA
    programs being told that anything outside the top 10 or 20 would be a
    waste of time. On the other hand a degree in mathematics is much less
    dependent on the school (conditional on being above a certain level, so
    the heuristic would apply to the differene betwewn top 10 and top 2000
    schools).

    The same applies to research papers. In math and physics, a result
    posted on arXiv (with a minimum hurdle) is fine. In low quality fields
    like academic finance (where almost all academics are charlatans and all

    cultures, and the major systems of belief and value with which they have
    made sense of their lives. They should know about the formative events
    in human history, including the blunders we can hope not to repeat. They
    should understand the principles behind democratic governance and the
    rule of law. They should know how to appreciate works of fiction and art
    as sources of aesthetic pleasure and as impetuses to reflect on the
    human condition.

    On top of this knowledge, a liberal education should make certain habits
    of rationality second nature. Educated people should be able to express
    complex ideas in clear writing and speech. They should appreciate that
    objective knowledge is a precious commodity, and know how to distinguish
    vetted fact from superstition, rumor, and unexamined conventional
    wisdom. They should know how to reason logically and statistically,
    avoiding the fallacies and biases to which the untutored human mind is
    vulnerable. They should think causally rather than magically, and know
    what it takes to distinguish causation from correlation and coincidence.

    Now life is the only art that we are required to practice without
    preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the
    failures and botches, that are essential for the training of a mere
    beginner. In life, we must begin to give a public performance before we
    have acquired even a novice's skill; and often our moments of seeming
    mastery are upset by new demands, for which we have acquired no
    preparatory facility. Life is a score that we play at sight, not merely
    before we have divined the intentions of the composer, but even before
    we have mastered our instruments; even worse, a large part of the score
    has been only roughly indicated, and we must improvise the music for our
    particular instrument, over long passages. On these terms, the whole
    operation seems one of endless difficulty and frustration; and indeed,
    were it not for the fact that some of the passages have been played so
    often by our predecessors that, when we come to them, we seem to recall
    some of the score and can anticipate the natural sequence of the notes,
    we might often give up in sheer despair. The wonder is not that so much

    the process of making the natural seem strange, so far as to ask for the
    why of any instinctive human act. To the metaphysician alone can such
    questions occur as: Why do we smile, when pleased, and not scowl? Why
    are we unable to talk to a crowd as we talk to a single friend? Why does
    a particular maiden turn our wits so upside-down? The common man can
    only say, “Of course we smile, of course our heart palpitates at the
    sight of the crowd, of course we love the maiden, that beautiful soul
    clad in that perfect form, so palpably and flagrantly made from all
    eternity to be loved!”

    It wasn’t easier, the ghost explains, you just knew how to do it.

    It’s like… to someone who only knows how to dig with a spoon, the notion
    of digging something as large as a trench will terrify them. All they
    know are spoons, so as far as they’re concerned, digging is simply
    difficult. The only way they can imagine it getting any easier is if
    they change - digging with a spoon until they get stronger, faster, and
    tougher. And the dangerous people, they’ll actually try this.

    is consciousness more like the weather, or is it more like multiplication?

-- Scott Aaronson

More context:

    a perfect simulation of the weather doesn’t make it rain - at least, not
    in our world. On the other hand, a perfect simulation of multiplying two
    numbers does multiply the numbers: there’s no difference at all between
    multiplication and a “simulation of multiplication.” Likewise, a perfect
    simulation of a good argument is a good argument, a perfect simulation
    of a sidesplitting joke is a sidesplitting joke, etc.

    Maybe the hardware substrate is relevant after all. But [...] I think
    the burden is firmly on those of us who suspect so, to explain what
    about the hardware matters and why. Post-Turing, no one gets to treat
    consciousness’s dependence on particular hardware as
    “obvious” - especially if they never even explain what it is about that
    hardware that makes a difference.

    When I visited Dieter Zeh and his group in Heidelberg in 1996, I was
    struck by how few accolades he’d gotten for his hugely important
    discovery of decoherence. Indeed, his curmudgeonly colleagues in the
    Heidelberg Physics Department had largely dismissed his work as too
    philosophical, even though their department was located on “Philosopher
    Street.” His group meetings had been moved to a church building, and I
    was astonished to learn that the only funding that he’d been able to get
    to write the first-ever book on decoherence came from the German
    Lutheran Church.

    This really drove home to me that Hugh Everett was no exception:
    studying the foundations of physics isn’t a recipe for glamour and fame.
    It’s more like art: the best reason to do it is because you love it.
    Only a small minority of my physics colleagues choose to work on the
    really big questions, and when I meet them, I feel a real kinship. I
    imagine that a group of friends who’ve passed up on lucrative career
    options to become poets might feel a similar bond, knowing that they’re
    all in it not for the money but for the intellectual adventure.

    The moment I realized that if I fall, that would probably be my end, I

    The most traditional way to begin a study of quantum mechanics is to
    follow the historical developments--Planck's radiation law, the
    Einstein-Debye theory of specific heats, the Bohr atom, de Broglie's
    matter waves, and so forth--together with careful analyses of some key
    experiments such as the Compton effect, the Frank-Hertz experiment, and
    the Davisson-Germer-Thompson experiment. In that way we may come to
    appreciate how the physicists in the first quarter of the twentieth
    century were forced to abandon, little by little, the cherished concepts
    of classical physics and how, despite earlier false starts and wrong
    turns, the masters--Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Dirac, among
    others--finally succeeded in formulating quantum mechanics as we know it
    today.

    However, we do not follow the historical approach in this book. Instead,
    we start with an example that illustrates, perhaps more than any other
    example, the inadequacy of classical concepts in a fundamental way. We
    hope that by exposing the reader to a "shock treatment" at the onset, he
    or she may be attuned to what we might call the "quantum-mechanical way
    of thinking" at a very early stage.

    I'm a big fan of the cognitive utility of the old phrase: "The exception
    that proves the rule." But then I'm kind of an exception in that regard,
    since anytime I mention I like that, I get deluged with logical and
    etymological objections.

    I merely mean that an exception that is famous for being exceptional
    suggests a general tendency in the opposite direction. The canonical
    example is that Beethoven's titanic fame as a deaf composer suggests
    that most composers aren't deaf, while, say, the lack of obsessive
    publicity about painter David Hockney's late onset deafness suggests
    that deafness isn't all that big of a deal, one way or another, to
    painters. Judging from the immortal fame of Beethoven's battle with
    deafness, we can assume that there aren't many deaf composers, while the
    ho-hum response to Hockney's deafness suggests that we can't make strong
    quantitative assumptions about painters and deafness.

    Real probabilities about the structure and properties of the cosmos, and
    its relation to living organisms on this planet, can be reach’d only by
    correlating the findings of all who have competently investigated both
    the subject itself, and our mental equipment for approaching and
    interpreting it - astronomers, physicists, mathematicians, biologists,
    psychologists, anthropologists, and so on. The only sensible method is
    that of assembling all the objective scientifick data of 1931, and
    forming a fresh chain of partial indications bas’d exclusively on that
    data and on no conceptions derived from earlier and less ample arrays of
    data; meanwhile testing, by the psychological knowledge of 1931, the
    workings and inclinations of our minds in accepting, connecting, and
    making deductions from data, and most particularly weeding out all
    tendencies to give more than equal consideration to conceptions which
    would never have occurred to us had we not formerly harboured
    provisional and capricious ideas of the universe now conclusively known
    to be false. It goes without saying that this realistic principle fully
    allows for the examination of those irrational feelings and wishes about

    It is a sound maxim, and one which all close thinkers have felt, but
    which no one before Bentham ever so consistently applied, that error
    lurks in generalities: that the human mind is not capable of embracing a
    complex whole, until it has surveyed and catalogued the parts of which
    that whole is made up; that abstractions are not realities per se, but
    an abridged mode of expressing facts, and that the only practical mode
    of dealing with them is to trace them back to the facts (whether of
    experience or of consciousness) of which they are the expression.

    Proceeding on this principle, Bentham makes short work with the ordinary
    modes of moral and political reasoning. These, it appeared to him, when
    hunted to their source, for the most part terminated in phrases. In
    politics, liberty, social order, constitution, law of nature, social
    compact, c., were the catch-words: ethics had its analogous ones. Such
    were the arguments on which the gravest questions of morality and policy
    were made to turn; not reasons, but allusions to reasons; sacramental
    expressions, by which a summary appeal was made to some general
    sentiment of mankind, or to some maxim in familiar use, which might be
    true or not, but the limitations of which no one had ever critically
    examined.

    [...]

    It is the introduction into the philosophy of human conduct, of this
    method of detail-of this practice of never reasoning about wholes until
    they have been resolved into their parts, nor about abstractions until
    they have been translated into realities-that constitutes the
    originality of Bentham in philosophy, and makes him the great reformer
    of the moral and political branch of it.

    [...]

    Instead of taking up their opinions by intuition, or by ratiocination
    from premises adopted on a mere rough view, and couched in language so
    vague that it is impossible to say exactly whether they are true or
    false, philosophers are now forced to understand one another, to break
    down the generality of their propositions, and join a precise issue in
    every dispute.

    As we saw, the E1A team [at Fermilab] found for some time that there
    were no neutral currents---they wrote letters saying so, even drafting a
    paper to that effect. By late 1973 they had a great deal riding on that
    claim. A consensus that neutral currents did not exist would have
    vindicated their earlier caution; they would have refuted CERN and
    denied the Europeans priority. For all these reasons it is stunning to
    reread Cline’s [a leading member of E1A] memorandum of 10 December 1973
    that began with the simple statement, “At present, I do not see how to
    make this effect go away.” With those words Cline gave up his
    career-long commitment to the nonexistence of neutral currents.
    “Interest” had to bow to the linked assemblage of ideas and empirical

    Microphysical phenomena [...] are not simply observed; they are mediated
    by layers of experience, theory and causal stories that link background

    stubbornness not easily canceled by theory change. And it is this

    For men imagine that their reason governs words, while, in fact, words
    react upon the understanding; and this has rendered philosophy and the
    sciences sophistical and inactive. Words are generally formed in a
    popular sense, and define things by those broad lines which are most
    obvious to the vulgar mind; but when a more acute understanding or more
    diligent observation is anxious to vary those lines, and to adapt them

    Don't just tell me what you'd like to be true.

This is from Greg Egan's 1999 novel Teranesia; since there are no hits for
‘Teranesia’ in the Google custom search, I'm inferring that it hasn't been
posted before.

Here's a little background. This is a spoiler for some events early in the
novel, but it is early; it's not a spoiler for the really big stuff (not
even in this chapter). So Prabir lives alone with his father (‘Baba’) and
mother (and baby sister Madhusree who is not in this scene), and their
garden has been sown with mines for some very interesting reasons that
needn't concern us, and Baba has discovered this by being blown up by one.
But he's still alive, so mother and Prabir have laid a ladder atop some
boxes across the garden, and she's crawled along the ladder to rescue Baba
without setting off more mines. But this is harder than anticipated.

    She turned to Prabir. “I'm going to try sitting down, so I can get Baba
    on to the ladder. But then I might not be able to stand up with him, to
    carry him. If I leave him on the ladder and walk back to my end, do you
    think the two of us could carry the ladder to the side of the garden
    with Baba on it-like a stretcher?”

    Prabir replied instantly, “Yes, we can do it.”

    His mother looked away, angry for a moment. She said, “I want you to
    think about it. Don't just tell me what you'd like to be true.”

    Chastened, Prabir obeyed her. Half his father's weight. More than twice
    as much as Madhusree's. He believed he was strong enough. But if he was
    fooling himself, and dropped the ladder …

    He said, “I'm not sure how far I could carry him without resting. But I
    could slide the crate along the ground with me-kick it along with one
    foot. Then if I had to stop, I could rest the ladder on it.”

    His mother considered this. “All right. That's what we'll do.” She shot
    him a half-smile, shorthand for all the reassuring words that would have
    taken too long to speak.

    Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what he did.
    The goal he announces in the Metaphysics seems one worth pursuing: to
    discover the most general truths. That sounds good. But instead of
    trying to discover them because they're useless, let's try to discover
    them because they're useful.

    Most of the time he asked questions. His questions were very good, and
    if you tried to answer them intelligently, you found yourself saying
    excellent things that you did not know you knew, and that you had not,
    in fact, known before. He had "educed" them from you by his question.
    His classes were literally "education" - they brought things out of you,
    they made your mind produce its own explicit ideas.

    A good argument is like a piece of technology. Few of us will ever
    invent a new piece of technology, and on any given day it’s unlikely
    that we’ll adopt one. Nevertheless, the world we inhabit is defined by
    technological change. Likewise, I believe that the world we inhabit is a
    product of good moral arguments. It’s hard to catch someone in the midst
    of reasoned moral persuasion, and harder still to observe the genesis of
    a good argument. But I believe that without our capacity for moral
    reasoning, the world would be a very different place.

    Katara: Do you think we'll really find airbenders?

    Sokka: You want me to be like you, or totally honest?

    Katara: Are you saying I'm a liar?

    Sokka: I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing, basically.

    What we assume to be 'normal consciousness' is comparatively rare, it's
    like the light in the refrigerator: when you look in, there you are ON
    but what's happening when you don't look in?

    The words out of your mouth will literally be ignored, misheard, or even
    contorted to the opposite of what they mean, if that’s what it takes to
    preserve the listener’s misconception

Colin Howson, talking about how Cox's theorem bears the mark of Cox's training as a physicist (source):

    An alternative approach is to start immediately with a quantitative
    notion and think of general principles that any acceptable numerical
    measure of uncertainty should obey. R.T. Cox and I.J. Good, working
    independently in the mid nineteen-forties, showed how strikingly little
    in the way of constraints on a numerical measure yield the finitely
    additive probability functions as canonical representations. It is not
    just the generality of the assumptions that makes the Cox-Good result so
    significant: unlike some of those which have to be imposed on a
    qualitative probability ordering, the assumptions used by Cox and to a
    somewhat lesser extent Good seem to have the property of being uniformly
    self-evidently analytic principles of numerical epistemic probability
    whatever particular scale it might be measured in. Cox was a working
    physicist and his point of departure was a typical one: to look for
    invariant principles:

        To consider first ... what principles of probable inference will
        hold however probability is measured. Such principles, if there are
        any, will play in the theory of probable inference a part like that
        of Carnot’s principle in thermodynamics, which holds for all
        possible scales of temperature, or like the parts played in
        mechanics by the equations of Lagrange and Hamilton, which have the
        same form no matter what system of coordinates is used in the
        description of motion. [Cox 1961]

    Teacher: So if you could live to be any age you like, what would it be?

    Boy 2: Infinity.

    Teacher: Infinity, you would live for ever? Why would you like to live
             for ever?

    Boy 2: Because you just know a lot of people and make lots of new
           friends because you could travel to lots of countries and
           everything and meet loads of new animals and everything.

    We're similarly shocked whenever authority figures who are supposed to
    know what they're doing make it plain that they don't, President Obama's
    healthcare launch being probably the most serious recent example. We
    shouldn't really be shocked, though. Because all these stories
    illustrate one of the most fundamental yet still under-appreciated
    truths of human existence, which is this: everyone is totally just
    winging it, all the time.

    Institutions - from national newspapers to governments and politicial
    parties - invest an enormous amount of money and effort in denying this
    truth. The facades they maintain are crucial to their authority, and
    thus to their legitimacy and continued survival. We need them to appear
    ultra-competent, too, because we derive much psychological security from
    the belief that somewhere, in the highest echelons of society, there are
    some near-infallible adults in charge.

    In fact, though, everyone is totally just winging it.
