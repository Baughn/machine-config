# Advanced NixOS Configuration with AI-Assisted Development

A sophisticated NixOS configuration repository showcasing cutting-edge hardware optimizations, AI-integrated development workflows, and enterprise-grade service management across multiple machines.

## üöÄ What Makes This Configuration Special

This isn't your typical NixOS config. This repository demonstrates advanced patterns and innovative approaches that push the boundaries of what's possible with declarative system management.

### üéÆ Gaming Performance Engineering

**AMD 7950X3D V-Cache Optimization**
- Custom core pinning that routes game threads to V-Cache cores (0-7, 16-23) and parks frequency cores (8-15, 24-31)
- Eliminates inter-CCD latency stutter in gaming workloads
- GameMode integration with automatic core affinity management
- Kernel tuning: `amd_pstate=active`, `amd_prefcore=1`, `mitigations=off`

**Hardware-Specific Fixes**
- Logitech G903 mouse scroll wheel fix via libinput overrides
- 10G networking with Intel 82599 NIC and jumbo frame support (9000 MTU)
- Zen kernel with optimized I/O schedulers (kyber for NVMe, bfq for rotating media)

### ü§ñ AI-Integrated Development Workflow

**Claude Code Integration**
- Purpose-built tooling in `tools-for-claude/` for AI-assisted development
- Intelligent NixOS option search with colored output and size limits
- AIDEV anchor comment system (`AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, `AIDEV-QUESTION`) for AI context preservation
- Automated package classification between CLI and desktop applications

**Intelligent Automation**
- Smart update system (`update.py`) with fallback strategies and visual diffs
- Pre-commit hooks that enforce formatting and run comprehensive builds
- Automated linting with statix, deadnix, and nixpkgs-fmt integration

### üèóÔ∏è Advanced NixOS Architecture

**Modular Design Patterns**
- Custom `me.*` namespace for all user-defined options
- Hardware abstraction through dedicated `quirks/` directory
- Conditional module loading based on machine capabilities
- JSON-based application management with automatic categorization

**Enterprise Secrets Management**
- Agenix integration with host-specific secret decryption
- Multi-machine key distribution with user and system key support
- Secrets filtered by hostname to minimize attack surface

**Modern Version Control**
- Jujutsu (jj) instead of Git for superior conflict resolution
- Conventional Commits enforcement with proper scoping
- Colocated Git repository for tool compatibility

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom Service Ecosystem

**Rust-Based Microservices**
- **v4proxy**: IPv4-to-IPv6 proxy for Minecraft servers with comprehensive testing
- **rolebot**: Discord role automation based on user activity patterns
- **irc-tool**: IRC notification system with webhook integration for media management
- **aniwatch**: Automated anime file synchronization with cleanup scheduling

**Production-Grade Service Management**
- Systemd hardening with DynamicUser and capability restrictions
- Timer-based automation for maintenance tasks
- Multi-protocol support (IRC, Discord, HTTP webhooks, TCP proxying)

### üåê Network Infrastructure

**High-Performance Networking**
- 10 Gigabit Ethernet with custom udev rules for consistent interface naming
- IPv6-ready configuration with proper routing and jumbo frame support
- Service discovery via mDNS and LLMNR for seamless local network integration

**Multi-Machine Deployment**
- Colmena-based deployment with local and remote building capabilities
- Machine-specific profiles: gaming desktop, media server, IPv4 proxy
- Centralized configuration with distributed secret management
