<b>1. Introduction</b>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
In March 2000, James William Breen assigned ownership of the copyright
of the dictionary files assembled, coordinated and edited by him to the 
The Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group, then at
at Monash University (hereafter "the Group"), on the understanding that 
the Group
will foster the development of the dictionary files, and will utilize all
monies received for use of the files for the further
development of the files, and for research into computer lexicography and
electronic dictionaries.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
The dictionary files are made available under a Creative Commons

You are free:
<ul>
<li>to Share - to copy, distribute and transmit the work
</li><li>to Remix - to adapt the work
</li></ul>
Under the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>Attribution. You must attribute the work in the manner specified by 
the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they 
endorse you or your use of the work).
</li><li>Share Alike. If you alter, transform, or build upon this work,

<p align="JUSTIFY">
For attribution of these files, you must:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">in the case of publishing significant extracts of the files, or
material based on significant extracts of the files, e.g. in a published
dictionary or in 
vocabulary lists, clearly acknowledge that you used the files for this purpose;
</p>
</li>
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">in the case of a software package or WWW server, etc. which uses the
files or incorporates data from the files, you must:
</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">acknowledge the usage and source of the files in the documentation,
publicity material, WWW site of the package/server, etc.;
</p>
</li>
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">provide copies of the documentation and licence files (in the case
of software packages). Where the application packaging does not provide
for the inclusion of such files (e.g. with iPhone applications), it is
sufficient to provide links, as per the next point;

</li>
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">provide links to either local copies of
the documentation and licence files or to the locations of the files

<p align="JUSTIFY">
If a WWW server is providing a dictionary function or an on-screen
display of words from the files, the acknowledgement must be made on each
screen display, e.g. in the form of a message at the foot of the screen
or page. If, however, material from the files is mixed with information from
other sources, it is sufficient to provide a general acknowledgement of the
sources as described above.
