When you first start KanjiTomo, no file has been opened and the program is in <i>Automatic OCR</i> mode. This means that you can point the cursor anywhere on the screen and the program tries to identify the image under cursor as Japanese text. This is useful if you are using web browser or other program to display images. If you have static images on your computer, it's best to open them directly with KanjiTomo from the file menu.
<p>
If the image has large characters or complex background (for example in title page), it might be necessary to manually mark the text. This can be done by click and drag with left mouse button over image (file mode) or zoom frame.
<p>
When the program identifies characters, they are marked by red squares. <i>OCR Results</i> panel now shows a list of matching characters for each character image. If the correct character is not at top of the list, you can select it manually. If too many characters are selected, click the selected row to clear it. You can also use hotkeys <i>Alt+W</i> and <i>Alt+Q</i> to add or remove characters from selection. 
<p>
Selected characters are show in <i>Search field</i>. You can also input characters here yourself. All words starting with inputted characters are shown; add space to also search for ending words.
<p>
<i>Search results</i> panel shows all words in a dictionary that contain the text in search field. Click a word to show a detailed description in <i>Word details</i>. Hotkey <i>Alt+Z</i> can be used to copy the result to clipboard. 
<p>
The dictionary used is Jim Breen's <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict.html">EDICT</a>. Terms used in descriptions are explained in <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict_doc.html#IREF05">EDICT documentation</a>.
<p>
Hotkeys can be used to control the program, see below for examples. Hotkeys must first be enabled by setting ENABLE_HOTKEYS=1 in <i>config.txt</i> file.

<br>

In addition to EDICT, KanjiTomo also includes <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/enamdict_doc.html">ENAMDICT</a>, a dictionary for Japanese Proper Names by Jim Breen. This dictionary can be accessed from <b>Names</b> button or by the hotkey <i>alt+D</i>.

A dialog is shown where you can edit the details of the saved word. Hotkey <i>Alt+1</i> or double-click in results list also opens the Add word dialog.
